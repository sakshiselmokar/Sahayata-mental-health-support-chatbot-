1jfkrbv,I don't know why I've been alive for the past 11 months,"I don't fucking know. I'm tired. I'm constantly suffering and have always been for the past 11 months. Ever since it happendd. Ever since I caused my best friend so much pain and she cut me off. Ever since i threw everything away. Nothing is worth it anymoge. Ive been groomed, started self harming, seen pictures of extreme self harm and anorexia, developed bulimia and much more. I just want to feel happy again. The only way i can ever feel happiness again is by reconnecting with my best friend and fixing my mistakes. But that will never happen. Theres no chance of that happening. My life is now just one endless cycle of thinking that something is going to change but it never does. Im going to try contacting her but i know for a fact it will not fix any of this. Its inevitable. She will not respond well she probably has my number blocked. The past 11 months will never be able to recover from. If she responds she will either be polite about it and say she doesnt want to reconect or will be angry at me. Literally anything but her deciding to make amends could happen. I dont even know why im doing yhis. It's both because i have hope and because i know shes going to give me the final nuge i need to kill myself. I'm wrong for having hope. Any time i do i repress it. There is no hope for me. There is no hope for me in reconnecting. There is no hope for me. My life is just one long traumatic event i am currently living through. I try my best to repress things as they happen. Im scared of making memories. Rowan is going to give me the final reason i need to truly realize its hopeless. No matter what she does it will make me realize im gone forever. I'm a pathetic shell of the person i used to be. There's no recovering from this. All i have are my memories of the past before when i was happy. Rowan was the best friend I could've ever had and i ruined it. Ive learned my lesson but athe cost of my entire life.

Note-I've been feeling better lately,But I am still worried.I trully need some advices and opinions,sorry for triggering post.Thanks you.



Me,12f.I don't want to wake up anymore in the morning.I just want to sleep forever.I feel like the most disgusting person ever.I am feel absolutly hopeless.

As a kid,I already was an asshole.I won't go into details but I really was absolutly horrible and cruel.Yesterday,Confessed how much I lied to my family and they forgave me,I don't know how.It could almost have been the best day of my life.But no.Two years prior to today,I was groomed online by 14-15 y.o when I was 10-11(We broke up fortunatly).I was scared to blame him.So I blame myself.I convinced myself I could consent,seducted him and It was my fault,and that sex was normal for children(I think I enjoyed being Molested and then watched lots of porn in secret especialy BDSM).and since,I paraphilic thoughs and fantasies that I've been aroused by.I though it was normal to think about those things(Fellow children and also teens/adults,also slightly younger and I mostly wanted to be them/Because I was molestedat that age) because I though If I could consent they could too.I have especialy being fantasizing and masturbating about being the child and being the one molested/raped/incest almost and seeing it(not always,Which is why I want to die.I kinda wish I was still molested...) always self directed.A few days ago I realized how disgusting and wrong these thoughs were.I've cried alot these past few days.I am broken,I cannot be fixed.I have intrusive thoughs about younger children and voices that tell me it's alright/they would enjoy it because I enjoyed being molested(Which is disgusting but my brain refuses to know that),similar stuff and intrusive thoughs about molesting children(I also somehow what to be that child which worries me but as I said...I kinda want to be molested and all...)Zoophilia(I know it's not and I feel like I am not disgusted enough anymore,And I am numb after crying so much,It disgusts me even more)and lots of incest.I've also had lots of fantasies about me getting fuck€d and pretty violent ways....I also though I should loose my virginity at like,9.I have also accidentaly viewed child porn and I wanted to be that child and searched animal porn by curiosity...I wake up every morning feeling like the most disgusting person ever.Like a monster.I want to die.I am so gross.I can't currently get Proffesional help,Unfortunately.I just cannot.There is no hope left for me.I want to jump off the window or slit my wrists.The world would be better off me.I feel bad because my family are terrified of me commiting but I don't feel like I deserve to be missed.I am messed up in every ways possible,I can't live whit myself anymore.My family are literaly angels,But I am a stain on the whole bloodline.I've tried to drink alcohol behind their backs but I don't like the taste.I've almost wrotte my last wishes and my will.I have not much empathy either,it scares me(I never had much emphathy),and I am scared to do anything to a real child or even to a grown up in my family.I don't know how I can lack of basic morals and disgust to certain stuff,It makes me wanna die even more,It's as if no almost thoughs can make go away my very disturbing thoughs/voices telling me to manipulate people and all...I'm mortified.Am I the monster I swore to never become....deep inside I am disgusted but it's getting worse.I don't know,something changed in my mind after I was molested and all...Also I preffer older men than me since?(I know I have dad issues but....)At the same time,I'm somewhat scared of Adults.My family are mostly older people who are relativly close to die and I feel like I just brought suffering at their end.I am tired of my brain trying to sexualize everything that are absolutly inocent and stuff that should never be sexualized...I never had that before,I am tired.I am very distressed from all the very disturbing fantasies I had.

I also have weird and uncomfortable mood/personality swings....As much as my mind can be disturbed and I can be suicidal I can also become numb and/or weirdly and uncomfortably euphoric(Still shaking,feeling empty and fake,heart palpitations,feeling cold,nervous)and mentaly ""Normal""(Not aroused by those things and disgusted)....It's as if there was two people in there....or maybe it's some kind of coping machanism for my brain....I'm lost.It feels as if my brain was trying to ignore the obvious issue or something....which doesn't make me feel better.I hate these Euphorias/Numbness and stuff moments...it worries me,I'm still worried,but my brain somehow tells me it's alright and all while it isn't.Sometimes I just feel peaceful though....It's like a roller-coaster.

My brain also associate numbers to very specific things and stuff and wouldn't allow me to fantasise about some ages for some reasons???Maybe I made some kind of link between s€x and the age I was molested???Also,I always had a bad mental image of adults,I don't know why.My brain victimizes adults but not children also?Is my brain thinking upside down?


I also watched alot of slautherhouse vids when I was younger(And tried to do same to real animals) and had a very morbid curiosity in general.I wanted to commit homicide(Fortunatly not anymore) and I was very narcisistic and selfish,homophobic and all the brainrot stuff(I am once more,not anymore...except the morbid curiosity).I literaly still laugh about suffering and literaly gore like a fucking maniac.I feel guilty but I also think I kinda enjoy violence.....Maybe I'm sadistic???


Sorry,I felt like I need to vent here.advices are welcome.Im so sorry if it sounds gross,I am gross.Im just tired of waking up,crying,Having those disgusting thoughs,the groinial responses,Flinching,Trembling,and being nauseous,and struggling whit hygene.I just want to sleep and never wake up.I wish...I was normal.Im eaten up alive by guilt.I am also tired of my radical moodswings....And the self harm.Unfortunatly(people will say fortunatly)my family have hid the scisors and the nail cutter.I am tired of seeing everything and everyone as sexual.I sometimes think about myself being eviscerated,ect...I don't want to eat anymore.I want to vomit,I feel like food is stuck in my throat.Why can't I be perfect.

Sometimes, I wish there was a God to fix me.Or maybe that God is punishing me and everyone for existing.

I feel like I cannot be fixed.There is no hope...I just want peace and nothingless.Like before I existed.If anyone has useful advices,I will take them.I am tired.I can't even sleep anymore,everyday is hell.The only reason I don't kill myself is because my cowardly ass fears pain.I just want to cry and be a little kid again....My brother shouldn't have died when he was born,I should've.am I...a Monster?I feel like I am,I don't want to exist anymore,or at least not think at all and stay in my room...Am I fucked up beyond fixing?I feel like I can't rest,that If I let my guard down,my mind will be corupted by these thoughs and I will do something horrible.It's somehow becoming more and more difficult to lissen to reason and seeing what is right or wrong,I get very cruel and disturbing thoughs and I am scared and tired of arguing whit them to no avail due to my fucked up mind...I am almost tempted to just drink up the bottle of wiskey in the closet behind my parrent's and try killing myself....I can't sleep in peace anymore.I want to desapear.Why does my family even love someone like me...My art sucks,My weight sucks,my grade sucks,my imagination sucks,my thoughs suck,I SUCK.I am a disappointment.I can't pretend everything is alright anymore.Being alive sucks.I am pretty pathetic for being in love whit a fictional woman.Since I was born I just brought misery to myself and the others.I just want it to end sometimes.If my dad met me he would be so disgusted and disapointed.I can't go on whit those cruel thoughs I never wanted...I must be Illegal.Im tired of those thoughs about slightly younger children because I am trying to gauge my reaction to them because I am scared of being a p€do or something(Even though I wouldn't even dream of being intimate whit one nor am I atracted to them???)...Please help.My intrusive thoughs and past fantasies scare the sh!t out of me.I feel like my place should be in an mental asylum whit meds at this point.I want to die so bad,I don't beleive I can fixed anymore....I don't beleive I'll make it to 2026.But at the same time,I'm scared for my family....I'm stuck.Uterly stuck.I don't go outside,I'm scared to see children.I'm scared to be even more disgusting.What to do when your brain comes up everytime whit the intrusive though saying ""They would enjoy it"" everytime I see the most terrible things happen to a damn child....Am I some kind of monster or pedo?I would normaly be disgusted but my brain doesn't want to.Why can't I understand sexual trauma anymore....",2025-03-20 09:13:34,SuicideWatch
1jfkpt2,Am I stupid and shallow because I'm going to kill myself for this?,"i promised myself that once i get those individual class pictures, im going to kill myself. i look so horribly ugly in those pictures, i look like a whole ass man even though i am a girl. I LOOK LIKE AN UGLY BOY IN THOSE PICTURES.

we were in class earlier and i overheard my classmates talking about how we were all going to get those pictures already and- i look at there faces, and there all so fucking excited and satisfied because all of them are photogenic and physically attractive while im in the corner, mortified and trying to not throw up. i knew that this day was going to come and i feel like i wanna cry but i just feel so empty right now, i barely have any emotions left in me.

what's even worse is those pictures are going to be displayed on a school projector in our fucking auditor. my ugly face planted in the screen for everyone to laugh and ridicule at. i know everyone's going to take a picture and mock me in social media. years of bullying did me great, im so fucking embarassed for myself. i fucking hate 10th grade. i fucking hate graduation.

maybe im stupid for killing myself because of this thing but im tired of being bullied. im already so traumatized from everything that has happened to me from my early years up to my age (15) just because of my physical appearance that i can't even barely function anymore.i just want someone to tell me that it's okay to kill myself, hell maybe i even need someone to do it with me because im too much of a pussy. i really need to do it so badly before the graduation it's insane, i dont even have anyone to do it with. im stupid ",2025-03-20 09:10:51,SuicideWatch

I'm a freshmen in college who has somehow managed to fail at everything in my short life, the only thing it looked like I was ever good for was school, I only ever had about three friends all of whom have left me behind by now, I guess they just got bored of me. I failed at both soccer and baseball growing up (somehow managed to go an entire little league season without hitting first base once when I was 14 to my teams constant annoyance) got bullied off of my soccer team when I was about 15 because I was so bad at everything that my teammates were just sick of me. Never did any clubs or any other extracurriculars throughout middle and high school because I always just told myself that everyone would hate me, which kinda just tends to be true anyways so I guess I was right about that. 

Now I guess for the reason why I'm writing this, I said earlier that it looked like the only thing I was good for was school, and that was true for a while, I finished high school with all A's but truth is I was never smart from the start and I knew it, I never end studied for anything, because I couldn't it didn't help me learn anything, so I just blind lucked my way through school, my parents desperate to get some value out of me sent me off to be a physics major at a big university, and now I'm failing, when the semester ends and they see my grades I'm sure they will throw me out, so really I'm going to have to kill myself either way in a month or so, just wondering if I should do it now or later.

I really just made this post because the constant loneliness just kinda got to me, I've normally always tried to tell myself that it will be fine if nobody loves me, but now looking at the ceiling I just wish that anybody could talk to me without disdain in their voice. Anyways whether I die now or in a Month it doesn't really matter this post will probably just get swallowed up by all the other posts of people with far worse problems then mine, and then the world will forget I ever existed, nobody will cry when I die I just wished that I could have at least not failed one time, had one person who cares about me.",2025-03-20 07:37:50,SuicideWatch

1jfj1pe,Not Feeling Like Myself,"Lately, I've been feeling more combative with everyone. Always was the type to hit depressed episodes and have been seeing mental health practioners and adjacent for over a decade. Usually trying to get back up or immerse myself in ways to to gain new perspective.

Blah blah blah, childhood was truly abusive and could be filed in court. But I made my way out and now I'm back to zero the last 4 years. During these 4 years I've been dealing with a court case. 

Honestly, I've had attempts and also have tried to bounce back out of the exit mindset. But I find myself becoming a person I was not before my case. Last month I got out of  the hospital for a 104.2 fever and sepsis. 2 weeks later my car broke down too far to walk home:

My partner and I stopped by others to ask for a jump for my car. People kept passing by through the traffic light. I personally have helped others even if I had somewhere to be. I hate to see others struggle when I have the means to help. These people.....no fucks to give. So I lost my shit in a way I've never seen before. I punched a passing by car not caring if they hit me. Keep in mind this is Texas. So, a guy was driving but his passenger, a woman rolled down her window. Stated ""wtf is wrong with you bitch, you gone get shot in these streets"" to which I further lost my shit. Yelling ""shoot me then ho"". Truly daring her to pull that shit out. 

I wanted her to shoot me. I started further talking crap, very unlike me. To which she started waiving her gun around, I felt no fear. Just wanted my life to end. My partner pulled me away. She could've been harmed due to me losing my shit. 

Bottom line, I feel as if I'm not myself. I've become combative. At times even walked into highway traffic hoping to get hit by a car. Never been one to include others in my attempt. Always been private. Now it feels like any means will do. I don't like this or who I'm becoming. I see it in others too nowadays. Idk what to do anymore. I don't see the same girl who yelled at others for killing bugs, snakes, and other animals seen as a nuisance. Or who volunteered time and time again at homeless shelters and food pantries. I can see my humanity dying right before my eyes. Everyday I wake up angry. My shower thoughts are vengeance. My self-harm is full blown. And I can't even have basic convos with loved ones without drifting off into anger. I can talk, laugh, and help where I can still. But I'm a shell, waiting for my chance to make my suicide look accidental. Oh nooo, and 18 wheeler is getting in my lane.(I just stay in the lane) Ohh, a prescription for pain meds. (Let's take'em all and just say I didn't know in case I wake up). Bad vibes guy, let me get a date and see what happens. (Get drunk af and not think twice about going to his apartment.)

I'm just not me anymore. ",2025-03-20 06:58:34,SuicideWatch
1jfizyn,(Ex?) Girlfriend is so so evil,"So, I’ve had this friend for three years now. This is the closest friend I’ve ever had. She knows more about me than anyone on the planet. I’ve told her about my traumas that I’ve never told anyone else (SA) amongst other things. We started dating two years ago because we both realized we had feelings for each other. We texted everyday, super lovey dovey etc. I never thought for a second that she wouldn’t be in my life anymore because she hates me. I thought at the very least we would be close friends always. She came to me about her problems and I always listened. I can’t explain it but she just makes everything feel okay. 

We had sex (my first time), sent nudes (which I now regret) etc. Overtime the relationship got worse and she was rude to me. I can’t say that I didn’t do or say rude things as well during this time period, and I’ve sincerely apologized for anything I’ve done to upset her. During this time is when I started cutting myself on my thigh. I’d never done that before. Now I have 20+ scars all on my right thigh that are permanent (including keloids) unless I decide to laser them, as well as a vertical scar on my wrist.

She didn’t have friends until 11th grade, and around a year ago she started getting close to some people in her band class. I was fine with this and happy for her. I can’t say I didn’t feel jealous at times or concerned about being replaced but I never got mad at her or anything. Ever since september, she’s been more and more distant with me while she grows closer to her new friends, specifically one friend I’ll call F. She and F are really close and I think she likes F honestly. She started ignoring me and being mean to me. I tried to talk and naturally got upset at this behavior but it only pushed her away more.

This all culminated in her telling me to kill myself (knowing I’m depressed), saying I was never really her gf I just thought I was (maybe this was true for the past few months of our relationship but definitely not most of it), that I’m a weird bitch, pathetic, embarrassing, etc. She told me if I texted her mom about what’s going on that she would send my friends and family nude photos of me as revenge porn. Embarrassingly I’ve still been trying to win her back over the past month but she wants nothing to do with me. What happens is she says sorry and pretends to care about me for a day (tops) before doing the same routine of ignoring me even when I say it’s effecting me mentally.

I tried to kill myself and it didn’t work. While throwing up after the attempt my mom saw my scars and now knows I self harm. Another time I was trying to hang myself but my mom heard and came in terrified. I feel so bad for my family who I’m hurting but I can’t fathom how someone who used to love me so much can treat me like I don’t deserve to live. Yesterday she said “I’m so fucking sorry” just to ignore me all of today and say “why does your mom type like shes r*tarded” after my mom texted her because she was CONCERNED about me. She also has been making fun of me with her friends, and is friends with a racist person who says slurs (She’s white; I’m not) who I assume she’s been talking about me with. 

I went through my moms phone to see the texts and she was not concerned at all. My mom didn’t even tell her that I was okay yet and all she said was “What do you want”. When my mom talked about how she’s concerned about me she told her that I’m “extremely ill” and need a psychiatrist. My mom asked her to be a good friend to me and she said “I don’t have the time”. 

I know it’s embarrassing to care this much about someone who is so obviously an awful person but when this person has spent the past two years loving you it hurts so badly. I don’t understand how she can change so fast. I guess she was just using me because she was lonely. Now she hates me. I don’t have any friends, she  was my only close friend. I’m so alone and I just want her to be there for me like she always has been but she doesn’t even care that I attempted suicide. I think I will kill myself tonight. 

If anyone has any questions whether it be about the relationship or just about myself id really appreciate it so I could get this off my chest. It’s too embarrassing a topic to talk to people I know about it

1jfiuot,Ugly and Finally Might Be Done,"I don’t want to die, but each day the thoughts get louder and louder I don’t know if I have the strength to carry this pain. I don’t want to be stuck in a body that has an ugly face and masculine build when I’m a cis woman. I just want to go out into the world and be okay looking , but I’ve come to terms with the fact I’m probably not. 

I hate that I feel this way since I’m so privileged when it comes to academics, strong friendships, and on paper have a bright future ahead. Yet I can’t bear this burden of self loathing and insecurity anymore. I think about it from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed, I just want the pain to stop. I just want to be loved. I just want to not be degraded because of my appearance.

1jfimtm,The end’s approaching,"I truly believe these are end times. I’ve witnessed my downfall up until this point, it slowly built up then came crashing down. I’m just a burden; a thing that’s there for my parents to remember I exist and then lament. Have lost virtually all my friends, family friends, family turned their back on me. Immediate family made me their enemies. Struggling so badly with anxiety and horrible intrusive thoughts. I don’t know why or how but people can read my thoughts and my actions which is so scary. I can’t even think or cry or sleep peacefully because my neighbours hate me and keep trying to disrupt me all the time by slamming doors, mocking me by coughing etc. It’s been days since I slept well. 

I think back to when I was that clumsy little 4 year old going into school for the first time, dropping my things, picking them up, then dropping them again and I’m still the same. When I was 4 and sat alone and couldn’t zip my bag so started crying and kids gave me weird looks and mocked me crying; was very much indicative of my life today. Some people are meant to be alone and not moulded to be smart or strong enough for the world and I truly believe I’m one of those people. They won’t fit in no matter how much they try. I don’t see my life getting better from here. I’ve had the privilege to be born in a physically perfect body and never lacked anything materially, yet I turned out to be a total waste of space. There are people who have smiled at me and wanted to know me but I just rejected them because I don’t feel anyone should have the displeasure of knowing me. 

If I could give my life in exchange for someone who lost theirs I would. If I was to die painlessly tomorrow I’d want it to happen. I’ll be 20 in a couple months and I don’t think I’ll make it till then. I’ve been struggling for a long time and it needs to be put to an end. I don’t want to feel so depressed and embarrassed to the point I can’t move, anymore. Empty and hopeless. I’m scared of the pain of cutting my wrist because it has to be like a proper full slash. Maybe bleach or inexpensive weed killer. ",2025-03-20 06:26:57,SuicideWatch

1jfi9aa,"Girlfriend is suicidal, and I feel guilty over my feelings","I just need to get this off my chest because I don’t know how to process what’s happening and if it’s a “normal” reaction.

I have struggled with passive suicidal ideation, but never suicidal ideation. I have never made an attempt, plan, etc. 

My girlfriend has been struggling with suicidal ideation for a couple months now. We’ve been working really hard on it, she’s going to therapy, taking medication, keeping herself busy with school and work, going out on dates, everything we can think to improve it. Nothing has helped.

I am currently on a work trip, and she called me to let me know she took an entire bottle of naproxen, but panicked after and called 911. She doesn’t take naproxen and her friend is supposed to handle her meds, so I’m guessing the friend is just a dumb bitch and left shit lying around. When I’m home all the meds and kitchen knives are locked in my gun safe that you need my thumb print for, and all my guns are at my dad’s house until this ends. 

Now onto why I’m making this post… I am so fucking angry. I’m so sick of dealing with it and worrying about it. I’m not angry at her, I know she’s not trying to, but this has been taking up so much of my time, money and mental energy for so long that I am absolutely sick of it, and I hate that I have to lie to her and say “it’s ok” so I don’t upset her. I want to be honest with her always, but this isn’t something she needs to know. I hate that I have completely lost hope that it will get better because we’ve tried almost everything. I hate this nagging feeling I have in my head that the stress of this will last until it breaks me or she ends her life. I’ve been going to therapy myself for it, and my therapist is doing her best but realistically all she can really do is soften the blow. Nothing will improve how I feel about it until she gets better. 

Before anyone asks, she’s not pregnant, she’s not using drugs, her family life is fine if not a bit tense from what I know. There isn’t anything specific in her life dragging her down that I know of. ",2025-03-20 05:59:32,SuicideWatch

I can’t afford to drive them the 4 hours to their new owner’s house but she is an older lady so I volunteered myself to dig my hole even deeper.

I just finalized my divorce and even still my ex is abusing me psychologically and financially.
I have a tax refund coming but even that is just going to stave off the inevitable influx of bills I can’t afford.
I was awarded the house in our divorce. I can’t afford to keep it.
I was awarded cash from her retirement but that is already gone thanks to a combination of shady transfers she made and the administration’s hellbent efforts to destroy any retirement plans.

I am trans and not passing (nor will I ever be).

Why do I even bother? My kids hate me. My family distanced themselves years ago when I wouldn’t listen to their warnings about my ex.
And now that I have pull my head out of my ass, they are more intent on telling me they told me so than actually trying to redevelop any familial bonds.

Every time I feel like I am getting ahead, another dozen things come along to let me know that I am completely incapable of taking care of myself or my cats.

All I do anymore is quite literally try to make it from one overdrawn paycheck to the next.

But I am also too much of a coward to end myself even though I know that is what will be best for everyone.

1jfhkhb,Which option will be the best among these?,"1. Write a detailed letter and let everyone know what happened and that I've been struggling and it's not their fault before killing myself. 

2. Try to make it look like an accidental or natural death (i prefer this one, but will probably fail. I'll appreciate some ideas)

3. Go to a psychiatrist, get diagnosed and get medicine. OD on them. I won't leave a note, so if i get lucky, it'll look like accidental OD or suicide due to mental health issues. (It'll probably take time) 

Which will be a better option. I'm worried about my parents reputation as I'm from a conservative society and people are judgemental, and probably will shame me and my family by making stupid assumptions about the reason if i didn't leave a note. But i also want to ease the blow. If i left a note and killed myself,it might be worse for people who'll be left behind. Idk what to do. I just don't want to hurt anyone.

This has been going on for weeks now. With this project, if my interview doesn't pass, I have to wait another year to try again. The amount of shame that would be brought from having to try again is too much. I wish I never joined this organization, I wish I failed earlier in life so there wasn't so much pressure on me now.

1jfh8w3,My note to her,"[———],

I don’t know if you’ll ever read this. I’m not sure you’d even care to. But I needed to write this anyway.

I’ve spent almost every day since you stopped talking to me trying to make sense of it all, not just you but everything thats happened to me. And the truth is that I can’t make sense of it all. I keep going over every conversation we had, every promise you made, every plan we made together, every goal we talked about.

You told me that you’d always be there for me, and I believed you. I believed you when you said you cared, when you listened to me at my lowest, when I opened up about things I’ve never told anyone else. And yet, when I needed you most, you were gone. Just two weeks after we had a heartfelt conversation, all of that changed. 

It wasn’t the fact that you moved on that broke me, it was how you did it. How you hid it. How you left me to figure it out on my own like I was nothing. Like I never mattered. You told me it was because I liked you. As if that excused everything. As if it made it okay to push me aside like I was disposable. Almost like it was all my fault and that you believed everything I did was for that reason. How you told me you were going to tell me eventually. Like it changed the fact that I found out the way I did.

And maybe I deserve it. Maybe I deserve to feel like this. Maybe I shouldn’t have trusted you enough because that was a burden for you. A burden that wasn’t worth trusting me for. 

I’ve been sitting with this pain every day and I’ve stopped feeling like a person. And it’s not because of just you. You were just the one person I felt like I could trust. It just hurt me so much to feel so betrayed and disposable. On top of that, with everything going on in my life, I feel so much fucking regret and guilt. Especially with the way I handled things.

Now, I’m always so numb, so tired, so sad, so mad at myself. I just can't seem to get out of this cycle no matter what I do. I hate this version of myself. I hate these thoughts in my head. I hate it all. Betrayal creates such a bitter person of someone. 

I used to be so happy. So eager to see everyone around  me happy. So eager to make sure everyone knew I had their back when no one else was there, especially you. Now I feel like a shell of my former self. Like the old me is fucking dead. The old me that I  liked. With motivation and dreams and passion. That version of me feels so far away.

And I’m sorry. I’m sorry I wasn’t enough for you to stay. I’m sorry I wasn’t worth fighting for. I’m sorry I wasn’t someone you could care about the way I wanted to. I'm sorry that I ever came into your life. All I wanted was to make you happy because you helped me and I should have never taken that upon myself. I’m sorry I was a fucking burden to you because of that. 

I don’t hate you [——]. I wish I did because it would make this easier. I wish I could say I resent you, but all I feel is empty and broken. And now, I just want this pain to stop. And that's all I really want you to know. To not think that I hated you or that any of this was your fault.

Maybe this is selfish. Maybe you’ll think I’m just weak. But at least now you’ll know. At least now you won’t have to pretend anymore.

Just please know that, for what it’s worth, it was not your fault. It just happened to add up to my pile of pain. Please just forget I ever existed or atleast just think about the happy memories we had. 

Goodbye.

Since then, we've healed our relationship and we're close now. I'm glad we are, because I think I'm the only member of our family who knows she's struggling. She's going through a divorce from an abusive ex-husband, she's got degrees but can't find a job in her field and is not getting calls back in the retail sector despite having retail experience. Her car just got totaled. Leasing offices keep giving her the run around and taking her money, so she's couch surfing. Worst of all, she's an entire time zone away from me and my husband and I live in an apartment with our two cats and a baby (my sister has a cat and dog, but her car is hypoallergenic and our cats would aggravate her allergies). 

We lost our mom to cancer at the beginning of last year and her death brought up old wounds and grievances that caused her to cut off most of our maternal side of the family. She feels like no one wants her around and the reason things keep going wrong is because she's not supposed to be here. Her luck has been horrific across time and truly not by anything she did wrong. It feels almost karmic from a past life. I try to help her look for jobs even states away, I've sent her money, I talk to her every day even a little bit, just to make sure she knows I'm here for her and to make sure she's still breathing.

She has told me multiple times she's thought about giving up, and now she's bringing up the possibility of giving up her dog who she worked so hard to get. I fear that will be the final straw. I know if she could just get a job she'd be on the path to recovery and this is truly temporary, but she's struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel and I don't know how to keep her spirits up. I just lost a close friend a few months ago to suspected suicide under the same conditions (hurt by a man she trusted, housing insecurity, unable to find a better job, regularly voiced wanting to die). I don't want to lose my sister too. She has almost nothing left to live for. My daughter has her name for a middle name, that's how much she means to me. She's met her niece and I want my daughter to have memories of her aunt at least before she passes. 

I'm at a true loss. I don't know what to do. ",2025-03-20 04:05:21,SuicideWatch
1jfgimx,I got a job,I finally got a job after a year of being unemployed. I am still planning on killing myself but now I can save up money for my family to be taken care of and not have to worry about funeral expenses. Let's see how long it takes to save $4000.,2025-03-20 04:05:19,SuicideWatch
1jfge6l,There are no professionals I can talk to.,"I've thought about suicide for a very long time. When I was younger, I admitted it to therapists and psychiatrists, but not to the full extent.
Fast forward to present time, and over the past two years I've had severe trauma from mental health providers. Basically, the woman was accusing me of drug seeking and totally gaslighting me, and I broke down and said ""if I don't get proper help, I'm going to end up killing myself."" I didn't say this as a threat. I said it out of frustration and fear. This woman immediately threw me into the psych ward. It was awful. I went in for a routine med check, and ended up in the psych ward for five days. Completely unnecessary and absolutely terrifying. 

Since then, I've realized there is no one I can talk to about my suicidal thoughts. I'm not close to the point of actually taking my life, honestly it scares the crap out of me, but I think about it. A lot. I'm so afraid of I tell anyone that, I'm going back into the hospital. And for anyone who thinks the hospital could be helpful, it was a joke. It was an adult daycare, no help whatsoever, just traumatized me. 

So, I feel alone in my thoughts, and I don't think it's healthy, I want to talk to a professional, but I am just too scared. Does anyone else feel this way? ",2025-03-20 03:58:30,SuicideWatch

1jfg8ua,Trying to figure out how to reduce harm to my young son when I die by suicide,"Apologies for the rambling. It’s late, and I’m in a bad way.

It’s been over two decades that I’ve been fighting suicidal ideation, trying to get every type of help imaginable (meds, TMS, all kinds of therapies and programs, etc.), but I’ve finally hit my capacity and am starting to plan how to end my life in the coming weeks. I can’t handle the relentless backslides into challenge and pain, and I’m just so, so tired. My family of origin is struggling, and this week marks two significant death anniversaries — my sister’s and my best friend’s. I lost the latter to cancer last year, and I feel like so much of the light has gone out of my life since then. She was my person, and I know I will never have that again. I love my husband beyond belief, but it’s so, so different.

But I selfishly had a child almost two years ago because I thought things were finally better. I jumped through all kinds of hoops to qualify for TMS with my insurance, which finally — after years of struggle — was the one thing to truly lift my depression. I was married to the love of my life, pursuing a second Master’s in my dream field, and feeling so hopeful for the world. 

But three years in, life is just too much. Between my work, internship, classes, motherhood, etc., I am stretched so thin, and there’s no end in sight and nothing to even look forward to. I dread each morning and break down in sobs every moment I’m alone, which are just stolen moments in the bathroom at work or in the car. I need to breathe, and I just can’t. There is no time for hobbies or joy or rest.

But now I have my beautiful, wonderful son, who didn’t ask to be brought into this world. A former partner told me he could never have a child with me because he’d always be afraid I’d kill myself, and here I am, proving that asshole right.

How do I end my life in a way that won’t completely destroy my son’s? My husband lost his mom in a similar way, and I don’t know how to make this as easy as possible for my baby, especially since I know it will increase his own risk of suicide. He’s so, so young, and I know this will be an irrevocable harm done to my family. 

How can I soften the blow? Is that even possible?

My parents invested so much in me. I feel like a disappointment. I don't want to choose the illegal path. But I know the legal path won't get me where I want to. Tbh I don't even understand what is good or bad anymore. People who chose the illegal path ended up having more clarity than me. 

Everything scares me. Future is fucked up. Maybe if I were born 20 years before I would have a chance. Yesterday, I had the motivation to take caffeine to work harder. Today I am googling how much caffeine is lethal. 

 I say all this stuff to my partner who is fed up with me rn. I don't know if I am a red flag or a green flag. I know for sure I am a red flag to my family. I will turn 24 this year and still don't have a job. Everyone else has something figured out or doesn't have anyone depending on them. My family has hopes that I can't take care of . I can't even fulfill my responsibilities. Can't ask my family for money. At this point I am not even talking to them. I wish I could support my family. At the age where I can support them I am becoming a burden. I can't even do anything to myself.  You know why my family has to spend a lot of money to take care of after math. If I make the worst decision........it's just a few minutes.....but I don't want to burden my family more. 

Btw I have a master's degree in tech. I am not even bad at things idk hard luck? No one picks up my resume with no experience. Had to put in a fake experience.

1jfeh8h,I was so disgusting in th epast and i'm losing will to live,"im 17M.

Since i was 12, i've had a porn and masturbation addiction. This caused me to be desensitized to porn.

As a result, from ages 12-17 I resorted to online video chat rooms (like omegle) to meet girls and do sexual acts with them. Some of these girls were minors, and I would do inappropriate acts with them online. Yes, I was also a minor, but the age gap would sometimes be large (13 yr old girl while i was 17 or 11 yr old when I was 16). I never intented to talk to these younger girls, i'd simply match with them on the random website and do these sexual things.

However, I've never been attracted to younger/prepubescent girls. In real life, I've never had desires or done sexual activities with girls even 1 or 2 years younger then me. I've never felt urges to stare at younger girls, and I'd never pursue a romantic relationship with a girl that was younger than me. That's always been so disgusting to me, and the thought of doing anything like that physically disgusted me. But I still went on this website do these disgusting things. I was never attracted to these younger girls on the website whatsoever, but I still did it.

It was a few weeks ago where I realized how disgusting my past actions were. I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt for the actions I've done. It's like I had this eye opening moment where I gained awareness and consciousness of how disgusting my actions were. I feel so guilty and i'm losing a will to live everyday. I feel the need to tell everyone of what I've done and that i'm a pedophile. Since then, i've enrolled in therapy and I'm desperate to change and ensure that I never go back to these actions again. Now, I'd never go on that website EVER again, and I'm certain of it, and I've since refrained from watching any porn or engaging in sexual activity.

It’s almost like I can see all of it again like it’s a 4K movie playing in my head. That whole night where I called and texted dozens of times because I thought she may have gotten hurt at the concert she was at since even past midnight her phone location was still there (her request to have one another’s locations), drove an hour to the venue at 2am, and found her reclined in her car with a guy she met at the show


Of course, there’s more to the story, including her turning off the emergency bypass ringtone (which was her idea to have in the first place) and texting me when I nearly pulled up to the venue that she was home safe, but those are the highlights


I still don’t know for a fact to this day whether she did cheat on me or not. I definitely think that she did, but I don’t have proof. I feel like I can’t tell a future partner “oh, I was cheated on” without definitive proof because then I’ll look bad for assigning the label of cheater without having concrete evidence, only circumstantial


But anyway, what even is trauma? I’m spiraling so hard as I write this. Whenever I get these waves of emotions, these images trapped in my head, I just feel broken. I feel traumatized? Does calling it trauma help with realizing the pain of it? Is it even significant enough to deem trauma, or am I just devaluing how significant of a word that is by feeling like I may have been? Am I just trying to give it to the worst word I can think of because it was one of the worst things anyone has done to me? Surely, I can’t have ever faced trauma in my life without having experienced significant abuse or a near-death experience (that isn’t a suicide attempt)? Is it really TRAUMA or just a difficult life moment? Both? Does it even fucking matter what it’s called? Why do I even care about a label? Will I ever be able to trust in a relationship again?

I love cats and was surrounded by negative people so I was a parent to myself mentally and emotionally. I can't drive or go out on my own. And my sister and her boyfriend will give me concaquences for small things. I know they're trying to teach responsabillity, but the amount of threats and actions is just rediculous. Like one time, there was a misunderstanding of where to put my book in the doctor's office at one of my appointments, and I wasn't allowed to freaking read on the drive back! 30 minutes with traffic! I silently cried the whole time.Physcological damage. And my Switch is confascated for 3 days because my room was messey. They told me I would get it back when I cleaned! Not in 3 days!

It’s been like 5 years of avalanche of nonstop shit happening in my life and as soon as I resolve some of my problems, even bigger problems happen. I have health issues that cannot be fixed nowhere in the world . Had couple of surgeries that kinda keeping me +-safe but I can die any day. Lately I don’t feel anything good. Like not a single positive feeling. Rarely something bad. Usually nothing. I feel myself like I am in the bad dream that I can’t control all i can do is just watch how everything freaking up around me. Living in the small studio with my gf with panoramic windows. The place i dreamed about or even a life i dreamt about when i wad 15-16. But it doesn’t make a shit to me. I hate the person I am, I hate the place I live in and my entire life. All I want is to collect money and relocate to another country, start a new life. Just disappear and start from zero. Cut all connections with my past. I was working my ass out to make it but my health issue ruined my remote career in foreign company. Snd now I am doing shitty jobs to just pay bills and eat food. That’s it. I can’t afford anything else. Salary in my country is shit. Find a good job without connections is extremely hard. Move to Europe extremely hard. To USA nearly impossible. So I guess I don’t have point to live. I just tired of fighting for nothing. Tired of suffering and imaging myself in different place as a different person i want to be. Every single day I am floating in my head on autopilot thinking about scenarios that will never happen. Or dreaming about death. At least it will end it all.

I'm young so whenever people learn these things about me they say that it'll get better and I have so much time. But I don't think it will get better because I don't have the will to change.

1jfkbac,Am I struggling with something undiagnosed?,"Hey, I’m struggling a lot mentally, and I’ve been trying to figure out what’s wrong with me. I don’t want to self-diagnose, but I feel like I have real issues that are affecting my life. I’d appreciate any insights from people who have gone through similar things or have experience with mental health.

My Symptoms & Struggles:
	•	Extreme mood swings – I can feel confident and powerful one moment, then completely worthless the next, multiple times a day.
	•	Emotional outbursts – Sometimes I get really angry or aggressive without wanting to, and I regret it later.
	•	Self-worth issues – I either see myself as better than others or completely trash. No in-between.
	•	Identity confusion – I don’t know who I really am, what I like, or what my personality is.
	•	Overanalyzing everything – I think deeply about every small action, to the point where life feels unnatural and disconnected.
	•	Paranoia & hypervigilance – I feel like people might betray me or have hidden intentions.
	•	Fear of intimacy – I find it hard to express love, even to my girlfriend. Sometimes I cringe at closeness.
	•	Cutting people off easily – If someone hurts me even slightly, I instantly want to drop them from my life.
	•	Dissociation & numbness – I feel detached from reality at times, like I’m watching life from a distance.
	•	Lack of discipline & motivation – I struggle with school, focusing, and getting things done, even though I want to improve.
	•	Self-sabotage – When things go well, I mess them up, and I don’t know why.
	•	Deep trauma & family issues – My father is extremely controlling and emotionally abusive. He gaslights me, threatens me, and denies all responsibility. My mother shifts between understanding me and siding with my father.
	•	Repressed childhood stress – I don’t remember huge parts of my past, but I know I was mistreated emotionally.",2025-03-20 08:38:59,depression

Like people who go bully an elderly disabled person, or a spoiled rich kid who goes out of his way to go shit on a low income family. Me personally, I was treated horribly because I was a very short and small male. They also were not trying to ‘help me improve’ because, unlike what they can do, I actually picked myself up out of my rut and WORKED on myself to better myself, and they couldn’t have that! They stalked me and tried to block me from self-improvement. And surprise, these assholes never actually messed with anyone else who was bigger/taller/higher status. They just wanted to shit on the vulnerable. For laughs. Now I’ve had to deal with mental issues afterwards because of this and I feel so resentful toward them",2025-03-20 08:24:29,depression

I have a dream about travelling to japan, US and Norway to learn about their culture, but if something like that will happen, my life would be pointless.

Confidence and high self esteem comes from a result of positive reinforcement. I can't have that. I can't do the same things these people do and yield the same results. I will never make it far in life. I am tired of being lied to by these same people that looks don't matter. I feel the need to compete with these people, but I can't because of my poor physical appearance. I will never amount to anything because I can't. I've tried.

1jfj19k,"Feel lost and ready to give up, body is ruined at 26","I'm ready to give up. I can't shake the feeling that I've had enough. Here's a list of everything I hate about my life...probably insignificant compared to many people here but it's starting to affect my mental health. Posting this at 6am having had no sleep. I'm a 26 y/o guy, and nearly all of these problems are because of my body letting me down.

In no particular order:

- I have gynecomastia (mild man boobs) which came out of nowhere this past year. My chest swelled up rapidly, apparently my hormones levels have changed, but doctors cannot confirm why. I'm 26!? This is supposed to affect teenagers or men age 60+, not men at my age! I'm pretty skinny, so it looks weird that I have so much chest fat. It can be seen through shirts.

- I have torn my ACL in my knee and also have a labral tear in my hip, and a torn UCL in my elbow. I can't exercise, can't workout...all I can do is limp around. The NHS is useless & refuses to put me forward for an MRI scan. This all came from a single day at martial arts when i tried to do something with my life. Instead, my body is now ruined & won't heal without surgery. I can't do anything without pain & I've lost all my strength.

- I suffer from psoriasis on my face and scalp. Red, scaly, scabby patches all over the skin, which itch and burn. I've managed to find an ointment which has cleared it for now, but if I miss a single day of not applying it, my face explodes.

- I have a massively receded hairline and a gigantic forehead too, no hair on my temples. All my friends have perfect straight hairlines and thick hair of course. I can't really try hair growth products because they might make my gynecomastia worse. My hair is just a messy mop which exposes my horrible hairline with the slightest gust of wind. I'll be bald before 30.

- I can't grow facial hair besides pathetic wisps on my chin, and I'm stuck with a baby face too, so I look 20 with a **** hairline and no way of growing a beard. I'd love to be able to have a beard so I could try the bald + bearded look.

- I suffer from major acid reflux / gastro oesophagus disorder, heartburn and indigestion. I can't eat most meats or carbs without almost choking to death because they trigger a reaction in my throat & stomach. Medication helps this too, but again, it's yet another physical problem which I feel like I shouldn't be stuck with at this age.

- I'm not physically attractive. I'm below average height, skinny but now with a feminine chest, I have a massive forehead and a huge nose which has a lump in the middle from when I broke it 10 years ago. I have extremely narrow shoulders (deformed as my collar bones didn't grow properly), small feet, skinny arms & legs, and i weigh less than every woman that i know. I have a very fast metabolism which makes it virtually impossible for me to gain weight.

Re-reading my post, I've noticed that essentially all my problems are because my own pathetic, weak, unstable body is ruining my life when I'm supposed to be in my physical prime.

I'm trying so hard to combat these issues one at a time. I'd really appreciate any encouragement from this sub. I just feel lost. 5 years ago I had basically none of these problems apart from my big nose & forehead. Now everything is happening at once. I've always been in great shape because I've worked hard to stay fit, and now I feel like I've lost EVERYTHING through no fault of my own. I feel like if I only had 1 or 2 of these problems, I'd be fine, but they're all happening at once & i cannot fix any of them

1jfislm,The Distance Between Us,"I haven’t always been the best at expressing my feelings, but when I do, it’s always too late. I feel trapped inside this body. Not sure if I’ll ever be able to get out. Losing what once was my home. The feeling of nostalgia keeps drowning me every single day. I’m only 18. Back in the old days, people my age still had everything I could ever ask for. The world died in the blink of an eye. I go back to my home when I’m asleep, no stranger lives there. And I see them all, I see you, and we’re playing hide and seek, we laugh as one of us gets caught. You’re there. You all are there. I see your smile, I hear your laughter, your voice echoes through the room, and you’re happier than ever. I could feel your heartbeat as you hug me. My dear friend, wish I could stay asleep forever and be with you. I hate mornings. I hate how I have to deal with this life without you. I lost you the day I moved away, even though I was only 15, not knowing I would never get to see you again. I hoped you’d call, but you never did, at least not on your own. And when I called, you weren’t fully there. It’s like you didn’t even care. I couldn’t recognize the person I was speaking with. It was strange to see you so indifferent. Suddenly you slipped out of my hands. It’s been 3 years, your face, voice, and the sound of your laughter seem to be fading away day by day. I haven’t been able to replace you, I don’t think I ever could. I’ve become detached from the world, I don’t speak with anyone the way I spoke with you, so now I only live in my head. You’re not dead, but I believe I am to you. Even though I am trapped more than ever, and I would give anything to die; this bone-deep isolation still brings me peace in ways I could never explain.

1jfijmu,Idk,"I'm a 24 years old female. I don't know what wrong with me but I have thoughts of ending my life for about 3 years now but I don't want to do it because after thinking of ending my life after that I will think how sad my family would be when I die and maybe they will be blaming themselves because of it so I was afraid to do it. My mom and dad are separated. My dad works abroad and my mom too, so I live at my aunt's house. She's my father's sister and we're asian. I was still on college so I was not allowed to move out until I finished it. My aunt's house was very toxic. My father doesn't send the money directly to me and my sister but he sends it to my aunt. My aunt has a house and was renting another house. My aunt would leave me and my sister on the house and she would live on the rented house with his boyfriend. We would go for months without food supplies but she pays for the water and electricity bill sometimes she would miss it and the electricity would be cut off. When she give us food supply, it would be life 10 instant noodles, 5 or 6 cans of tuna and a half sack of rice then months would go by again. One day, she sent us one paper bag full of free sauce packets from fastfood restaurant and only sauce packets. My father works as a data administrator in a company overseas and he sends money monthly. I don't know where the money is. I have thoughts of many ways to end my life but I don't like hanging myself up. I was think of overdose of sleeping pills. I take sleeping pills because of insomia everynight. Now, It's been 2 weeks since we don't have anything to eat but dates that we have on the fridge from 2 years ago. When I go hungry I eat 1 date. I tried telling my dad that I want to find a job but he won't allow me and tell me to focus on my school so that I can graduate. I tried telling my dad about it but he will just take her side everytime and will just tell us that maybe we did something. The dates run out, I didn't eat anything for 2 days. Now, I am not afraid to hang myself and I want to really do it. I can't sleep, my head's killing me, I'm too weak to even grab my water bottle. Everytime I ask my grandparents that I want to move out, they will just tell me that my sister will be left alone. I don't know what to do now. I know there are more worst experiences that mine out there but I just don't know. ",2025-03-20 06:20:26,depression

I know I'm just a hormonal teenager but I'm on the edge looking over. I'm in my last year of highschool, but I'm not sure I'll make it. I've recently taken to cutting and it's helped a little but after I just feel ashamed of how weak I am. I shouldn't have given in I shouldn't be so weak. I should be able to solve this problem but I can't seem too. When I first realized I felt like this I kept as busy as possible to distract myself, and when that didn't work I got angry, but I'm out of stuff to do, and I'm out of stuff to be angry at other than myself. I just want to end it. The only thing keeping me going is knowing my parents and friends would likely blame themselves. I don't want to tell them that I only live for them because I know they would drop everything and I couldn't waste there time with that they shouldn't have to waste there time on me. I've been trying to wait out these feelings but they won't go away am I doing something wrong? Did u do something to deserve this? Am beyond saving?

I've been skipping college classes because I can't get out of bed, and oversleeping because it's the only escape I have. I might lose a scholarship because of this; it's based on my grades. I'm in a healthy and loving relationship, but it isn't enough. I've been having increasing amounts of thoughts of dying, no plan or actual intent, but they're still there. Negative thoughts saying I will never be successful because of depression and the memory issues that come with it.

I go to therapy every other week, and it helps on those days, but I don't think it's doing enough. My usual methods of coping and mood boosting aren't working. I just want to feel better. 

More context: diagnosed with anxiety and major depression since I was a kid, and I'm LGBTQ+. Not really close to my parents or family.

1jfhyxm,I feel confused and need to vent,"Hi, I have dealt with depression for many years. Things have gone better over the years but from time to time I would start to feel depressed again. 

I started psychological therapy at 18, at 20 I got referred to a psychiatrist and started antidepressants and and anxiolytics. I got diagnosed with bpd although, I have never done risky or impulsive things, I did have mood swings that would go from normal to wanting to die to normal again in short periods of time and had a deep fear of abandonment and attached deeply to people even when they hurt me. I had to change psychiatrist because he got too expensive but he referred me to another. I got off anxiolytics (apparently they are not very good for people with bpd) and after some months I was off antidepressants too, although I had to come back for a little while due to some personal stuff. After a year I “graduated”  therapy (it focused more on emotional regulation) and got referred to group therapy because I wanted to get better at socializing. I used to love talking to people, and soacializing, but now I am too scared to. I have gone through some shitty stuff, abuse, betrayal, harassment and have cut off a lot of people I cared for deeply because of them not caring for how I was treated or keeping in contact with the people harassing me. It was hard and it still hurts after some years.  

I have felt better than before, I now know how to be alone and deal with my things and ask for help sometimes. But I don’t really like myself very much, I am very awkward and I fear people don’t find me interesting enough. I have tried to change but I lack the confidence to do so. I do have very good friends but they are all very independent so I don’t hang regularly with them and feel alone most of my time, we don’t chat very often either. I want to do it more but I am scared of being a burden or being seen as pathetic, and I also respect their time and the attention they can give me and well, they do like to be alone a lot. I don’t know where to meet more people, I used to have a lot more initiative and talked to people more (even when scared) but everything started building up and now it’s so hard to speak with people. I keep them at arms length, and don’t go out too much, when I do it is very hard and extremely scary, I feel I am in so much danger. I used to have a lot of friends but we grew apart and I don’t feel like I belong anymore, but I know that’s just life. I know I can make friends or I used to be able to. it makes me feel sad that I have come to this. I never imagined still being in this stage in my life after so many years of actively trying. I have always struggled to really connect with people but more from my end, for example, people would tell me we have been friends for a year but I would feel that we either were not friends or have been for less time, but not because I didn’t like them but because it takes a lot of time for me to really feel I am liked. I don’t know how to stop feeling like that, I keep myself from connecting. I am scared they secretly hate me, or that I make them a favor by being away. Ever since I was 14 years old I have been actively trying to be better at socializing and getting better confidence, I used to read a lot of books on how to talk to people and watched videos, but I don’t get how to feel close to people, I don’t understand relationships, I know how they should look like and how I should behave but it feels like following a recipe. 

I am so confused and sad that after ten years of actively trying to learn and 7 years of therapy I still can’t. I don’t know how to be more likable without being too tryhard. And it’s getting hard again, I am having suicidal thoughts again, I cry often and at night I have the worst anxiety, my heart pounds too much, I get dizzy, feel a pain in my chest and that’s when I want to die the most. I still feel in control though, I am in no danger, I don’t self harm nor have real intentions of following through, but I do feel a little suicidal. 

I don’t know if I am making sense, it’s late, I am tired and confused and don’t really know what I am searching for with this post. I just needed to vent. I do have friends I can talk to, but when I was very depressed I overwhelmed a friend with it, I used to ask if he was okay with me talking about it so often and he always gave me permission to do it ( I did ask if he was okay to listen every time I unpacked) but he wasn’t, and eventually it was too much for him and our friendship ruptured. It hurt a lot but I get him, I have tried to fix it and especially now that I am better but he has moved on and even though it’s sad it is okay. But due to that I am scared to talk about this things with my friends too often, I am scared I might lose them as well if they can’t draw the line for when it is too much and I cant read minds. And I have been feeling low more often. 

I want emotional connection but it’s hard for me. I want to meet new people but I don’t know where or how. I want to like myself more, i have a lot of things I value a lot and I work on myself so much. But because I don’t feel liked by others I stop liking myself. I am proud of who I am and how much effort I put into all aspects of my life. But it’s sad that I put in so much effort and attention and not be able to have satisfactory friendships. I want to change, I want to learn and grow but I just can’t understand relationships, I can’t assimilate that I am worth people’s time and affection and automatically decide to “let them be” and not to “annoy them with my presence”. Even if now I am not in danger I do feel that if this doesn’t change I will end up giving up in some years, it’s hard to enjoy things.

I feel I try so hard at life and still suck haha. I do have healthy habits, I eat well, force myself to have breakfast which I hate, force myself to exercise, play an instrument, I am learning my fifth language, I have a stable good paying job, I have great finances and have been investing for some years, I do invest in skin care and hair care, I journal, and I am going to my dream internship as well. I do all the healthy things people advise you to to have a healthy, happy, fulfilling life but it doesn’t work. Like I said, it feels like following a recipe, a set of rules but it does nothing to me. I don’t enjoy anything. I don’t know how to just exist, I feel the need of a set of instructions on how to “human”. I feel hollow.

I am sorry if this is long, boring, confusing. I am very confused. I don’t know what I lack. And I know my experience isn’t unique and would like to hear about other people that have felt this way, I want to hear perspectives and advice. I feel more lost everyday.

1jfhrro,Just need to vent.,"
27, no friends, never had a girlfriend or sex. Incredibly lonely. Incredibly depressed. Done nearly every treatment under the sun, but nothing helps. I’m worried my life will never get better.

The thing that concerns me the most, obviously, is my complete lack of romantic and sexual experience. I feel like I’ve missed out on something fundamental, and every year that passes makes it harder to imagine things changing. The other day I saw a 15 year old kid grope his girlfriend’s breasts and as I’ve never touched a woman’s breast It made me want to kill myself. I had to call a crisis hotline. Every year the pain gets worse. I am terrified my only experience with love will be unrequited love. I feel like i have so much love to offer but the women I want are never interested. 

I work part time, my depression makes it hard to do more. Thankfully my family is well off enough it isn’t an issue. I go to the gym, been the last three days in a row which I’m proud of. I am starting to volunteer at an animal shelter. Hopefully I meet someone there but I doubt it.

The last few days I have been more hopeful that things will get better but part of me still thinks that it won’t and I am destined to be miserable and alone my entire life. I feel like the road I’m on will lead to suicide no matter what I do.

1jfhrhf,"I got ""hit"" by a car a couple of days ago and i think i had an weird reaction","i say ""hit"" because im here typing this and im like fine but i was just thinking about it and joked to myself that i had really bad survival instincts but now i think i had a really weird reaction to it. I was walking home from aldi's and to get to my place i gotta cross a main road that doesnt have a cross walk. Mid way through me crossing the street the lights turn green and ig i just assumed that they would wait for me to finish crossing the road. I saw the car hit the gas but i guess i kinda just assumed that it was like them tryna see if they could get past me before i crossed them or like a scare tactic thing to get me to walk faster and they would stop but they didnt. It wasnt like ""I saw everything in slow mo"" or anything. I saw it coming, i had plenty enough time to jump out of the way, or make a sound or do anything. But i didnt react at all and i just watched it hit me like I was watching it through a tv or smthn. I realize now that i got lucky i think she hit the brakes soon enough where she wasnt going do real dmg. It really didnt hurt much but im realizing that I was lucky that she saw me in time enough to hit the brakes.

I think the biggest thing is that i just really didnt care. I feel like i should or like at least get mad that she wasnt paying attention and hit me but the only reason i was annoyed with her is because she kept asking if i was ok and i felt i needed to reassure her that i was fine before i felt that could just walk away. I didnt really have any thoughts about it during it either. It was just ""that car is going to hit me."" i didnt think about if it would hurt or anything, I wasnt mad or shocked when it actually connected. I didnt even brace for it. There was no fight, flight, or freeze or anything. I treated it with all the mild inconvenience of me walking into a table. I just kind of bounced off and kept walking.

I feel like seeing the car coming at me really should have been scary. I feel like the fact I didnt really care should also be scary. But I dont really know. i still don't think it was a huge deal but i feel like I should've had more of a reaction. I didnt even really care enough to like exchange info or even turn back around until she called out to me or anything. I just walked away after like the 10th time i said i was good.  It made me kind of think back on a lot.  I've been told for years that i never really have a reaction to anything, good or bad, and i just kind of chalked it up to me not really caring but i feel like it should be different if im the topic. idk if im overreacting, which i guess would be good in this case?

I know im not doing well but I've not really thought about it. Ive been in a pretty bad loop for like 4-5 years now, but the fact that i couldnt even care enough to move out of the way of a car coming at me probably means im doing a lot worse than i thought.",2025-03-20 05:24:46,depression
1jfhqfq,"I'm giving up on my dreams, but that's a good thing -->","Hear me out...This is not self-pity, it's a realization i just had after going through depression and hearing my mom cry on the phone because i told her how much i wish i could just end my life. One thing i can bear less than my own suffering is witnessing my mom suffer because of me.

Most of my suffering stems from my desires and dreams for MYSELF. I thought i wasn't demanding much from life, i just wanted a place of my own with a garage/basement that i can turn into a workshop so i can be creative. That's pretty much it. Never cared about nice cars or any kind of luxury. I already made peace with staying single forever, after 13 years single i just don't care anymore, but in a good way. The desire wore off. (I'm 42 male and pretty handsome haha...anyyyyway...) That's one major desire that caused a lot of suffering that's gone. And i feel the burden lifted off of me. Don't get me wrong i'm still open to it but it's just not important anymore. 

I realized that helping my mom and my sister means the world to me. In order to do that i can abandon or at least deemphasize my desires because they are in the way. Not that having them fulfilled would be a problem. It's my suffering that stems from my attachments that is the problem. So i'm letting go. 

In the grand scheme of things what do my desires really matter? Endless lives have been lived. Endless lives will be lived. Even if all my dreams will be fullfilled, it's only gonna last for a blink of an eye. Of course it's hard. Even if i let go of my attachments (for the most part) i will still suffer. Accepting that might give me some peace. 

I do hope that i will ascend in some kind of spiritual way. Maybe reach the next level. Hopefully pass some kind of cosmic test. Maybe i won't. What does it REALLY matter? I don't care anymore, but in a good way. Maybe that is what people mean when they talk about surrendering to GOD.",2025-03-20 05:22:45,depression
1jfhq6c,Nostalgia/depression,"Hey everyone. Thought I’d share this, 

I go to weekly therapy for depression, OCD, and anxiety/panic disorder along with PTSD and some phobias I need to work through. 

One thing that I have been seriously struggling with with my depression is nostalgia. I feel as though I almost missed out on some things in my child hood because of specific phobias and well everything I listed above. But also just the longing to go back in time and experience being a child again with no care in the world, when school was fun, and just doing anything I wanted really. I shared this thought with my therapist and she said “well why don’t you”. 

Immediately confused (now that I am 18) and she asked me what things I liked doing as a kid. I really said being outside and building forts in the woods, playing on play grounds and stuff like that. She then asked me what hobbies I had as a kid. Immediately I said “well I had a harmonica I loved to play”. So right then and there in my therapy session I ordered a harmonica off Amazon. 

Since this discovery I’ve done more hobbies. I’ve made slime with friends, walks in the woods, welded (don’t really know why I was using a torch as a kid but here we are), done some simple art projects (as an artist I really give myself no enjoyment any more doing art  for people because I feel it has to be perfect), and heck I even climbed the same huge tree the other day that I climbed when I was a kid!!

I know doing all this stuff doesn’t fix depression but to me it is a start. So I thought I would share incase someone is struggling with something similar. 

In the next coming weeks I am taking myself and some friends to a drive-through petting zoo!!",2025-03-20 05:22:18,depression

1jfhizq,I’m helpless and need any advice I can get,"I'm 14 female and I don't know what to do. I have a therapist but she doesn't help because she's constantly telling me things like ""breathing techniques"" or listening to music but that don't do anything in terms of help me get through life. Sometimes I have dreams of being a doctor and getting married and being happy but I don't know if I'll make it out of high school. Every morning I wake up and sob because I didn't want to.

At school, I'm reduced to my GPA. I can't do all the work because it overwhelms me and it tanks my grades. So everyone thinks I'm stupid and my friends make fun of me. My parents are disappointed and try to help but nothing really helps. Nobody talks to me aside from my ""friends"" who constantly ignore me or insult me. Going to school is like being put into the middle of the ocean with no one near me. I'm always tired and struggling, I know that nothing can save me, and eventually I will drown. 

At home, I have nothing. My family is great but they don't know how to help. I go days without stepping outside, some days without eating. I just bedrot. My room is piling up with clothes and trash and food. Everytime I see the mess, I can't help but sob because I'm a useless piece of shit who can't even find the energy to push it all into my closet or throw it away. I am never able to go out by myself because I was kidnapped before and so my mom is overly cautious which I understand but I feel like I'm suffocating always being in this house.

I don't see a way out so I'm looking for generally safe self-medication. I don't like alcohol and weed it illegal. I'm open to try anything in hopes of not killing myself. No, I will not talk to my parents or therapist about the suicidal thoughts or wanting to go on meds. If anyone has any advice, please comment it.",2025-03-20 05:08:48,depression
1jfhgwx,Just need someone to respond,"Hi all,

Throwaway account.  I have literally no one to talk to so I thought this would be me feel a little better.  I’m in my early 20s and feeling the lowest I’ve ever felt.  Currently, for the past week I get up and just wait for bed time so I can turn off my lights and cry.  Before this week I hadn’t cried in idk how long, but it’s coming easy now.  

My current lull started over a girl I guess but I’ll give some back ground info.  Since 2020 I began struggling with anxiety really bad, from zero to 100 out of no where having panic attacks.  In conjunction with this new anxiety and quarantine, this enabled me to pretty much hide from everything which was probably the worst thing that could’ve happened.  Slowly Lost contact with all my friends because I stopped going out in social gatherings, no I have really no social life or anyone to talk to.  I just go to school idek why at this point, barely have any motivation to do assignments.  But about 7 months ago I started a new job, at this time I wasn’t really depressed just had bad anxiety but slowly it was getting better.  Then after a few months a new girl gets hired, Alex.  And idk why but at first sight I was in love, not actually but you know what I mean.  Huge crush on her.  Still struggling badly with social anxiety/awkwardness, so I didn’t have the courage to talk to her besides giving her a smile and saying hi while passing by or holding the door open for her.  I can talk to anyone with no anxiety, but the second I have a slight crush on you all my social skill fly out the window and I overthink everything and become incredibly awkward.  Anyways my anxiety has been getting better and I could start to feel comfortable enough to get to know her and ask her out.  Finally my anxiety was getting better and I worked up the courage to talk to her at the end of the work day.  I told someone I work with I thought she was pretty and that I was going to talk to her and they were like oh yea she is, but you know she has a boyfriend?  And dude my heart just freakin sank.  And to make it worse he also works at our work and now I see them together it just sucks, so much.

Now I can’t stop thinking about her wtfff, just ruminating on what could’ve been/what I wish would’ve been.  I’m normally not like this though.  I think it’s hitting me bc for the past 5 years I’ve struggled with anxiety to the point that i willingly let me social life die and pretty much just came to terms that this would be my life from now on.  That I wouldn’t have a gf, no wife, no kids, I just came to terms that I’d die alone and that was just the cards I was dealt, horrible way to think I know, but it made it a little easier.  I think it sucks so much because I’ve finally gotten to a point where I feel like I can begin to have a life again, I can think of having a gf, the one girl I was interested in, in years, has a bf and now I don’t even get to shoot my shot.  Idk this was so freakin demoralizing and just made me feel hopeless.  Especially bc I couldn’t even tell you the last time I found a girl pretty or was interested and she’s really cool from everything I’ve heard pick workers say about her, literally my type personified.  So now I just walk past her everyday and it’s a reminder that I can’t do anything about it.  

Idk if it’s even about her that I’m feeling so down or more so the fact that I just feel like I’m never going to experience love in addition to having zero friends.  I just go to work and do homework.  Feeling really fuckin down, no one to talk to AT ALL.  Only thing keeping me going is the new Carti album fr.  “Like Weezy” has been lifting my spirits up.  I think for the past few years I’ve had mild depression just because of the anxiety that prevented me from doing the things I wanted/used to do, but that slowly took a toll on me to the point that I’m just a shell of what I used to be.  At this point I’m rambling, this made feel a little better.  Thinking of trying meds to get rid of anxiety/depression idk also kinda embarrassed to though especially as a guy.

TLDR; anxiety has run my life for the past 5 year, lost social life due to extreme fear, finally started to get a little better and began picturing getting a gf, started crushing on a girl just to find out she has a bf the day I worked up the courage to say something to her.   Now I can’t stop thinking of her and it makes me feel like I’m never going to find love and how shit my social life is and how bad my life is in general.

1jfhg1t,"Is he depressed, or is he just not into me?","A guy (33M) I’ve (29F) been seeing on and off for a while shared with me a couple of months ago that he has a long-term diagnosis of a depressive disorder (did not disclose the classification) and takes SSRIs.

He’s a very kind person. When his depression kicks in, his go-to coping mechanism is withdrawal and isolation. Most of his energy seems to be spent on maintaining a stable work life. I’ve come to accept that he is emotionally unavailable. I don’t expect him to commit to a relationship with me. 

I have BPD which I can mask for the most part. But whenever I’m seeing someone, I’m always dreadfully suspicious that they don’t actually like me. 

Recently, he cancelled a date on me at the very last minute, saying that he feels completely drained. We were supposed to meet after work (our offices are close to each other), so at least it’s not as if I went out of my way to see him. I told him that it’s okay, and that I’m there for him. Deep inside, though, I am disappointed. 

He once told me that my energy gives him joy, and that his life is better with me. If that was true, then wouldn’t he want to see me even while he’s down? I fear that he might only be seeing me because he knows I like him and doesn’t have a reason to outright reject me. The lack of transparency is killing me. I’d like to see insight from those who struggle with depression and social withdrawal tendencies.",2025-03-20 05:03:34,depression
1jfh4wo,2×(2+2) if this ain't stressing u out doesn't mean it ain't stressing out a 3yr old.,"Hi, I'm 12 currently in 7th grade. 
Judge me later but let's go through my routine first. 
Wake up - 6am
Go to tuition-7am
Come from tution and get ready - 9am
Go to school - 10am
Come back from school - 4:30pm
Go to tution - 5:30pm
Come back from tution - 8pm (quick dinner) 
Do all of my homeworks from 9pm to 12am.

I spend more than 5 hours in tution every day
Then comes 6 hours in school
Homeworks takes more than 3 hours 
So I spend more than 14 hours studying. 

I also have a personal life. I don't have a day off. I follow this routine 24/6 cuz I don't have school on Sunday so I spend more than 6hrs in tution that day. 

And if those online tests are accurate then I'm kinda in depression. I don't want to live like this all my life. My dream is to be a CyberSec engineer. 
I don't want to study what bengalis used to eat back in the day. I want to study about computers. 
I only love studying computer, English and mathematics. My parents only care about grades I even thought of cheating in the exam just to get good grades.

I can't give all of my homeworks on time everyday. I get hit by the teacher, scolded by the teacher.
I cry almost everyday. Last night I couldn't even help it I cried for like an hour. If I give that statement to my teacher she'll say why did you waste an hour? do you know how much work you could've completed in that time? 

Only adult's can't have stress and depression. Kids can have it too. Study shows that pre-teens need more sleep than a adult for their mental and physical growth. Here am I can't even sleep properly without having to worry about tution and homework.

1jfgyi9,If I could smoke fear away I’d roll that mf up,"24m. Feels like life is just passing me by. I’m a college grad living with my parents barely scraping by. Working full time, have no energy, this time in my life feels like a black hole. I want so badly to do something great and embark but idk what I want to do. 

I’m a virgin and I’m still afraid to put myself out there. I know this is pathetic. Never had a gf. I’m real lonely. Even my best friends are like “are you even interested in relationships?” Most of my friends have SO’s, some will be getting married soon. Oh yeah, I also might be in love with one of my best friends, who’s gonna marry one of my other best friends in the next year or two. Oops

The crazy thing is I always knew this would happen. I always felt cursed somehow. I tried to smile at a woman at the gym yesterday and it must have looked like I had a facial spasm. I’m like Chick Repellent, like tick spray or something. When I die they should make my ashes into a spray and sell it. I was just always too nervous, afraid of being judged, afraid of being a creep, and I still am today.

I wish I was never born. I wish I had the balls to end it but I don’t. But I can’t go on like this either so something has to give. I hate myself for all of this. I know this is super pathetic to all you normal people",2025-03-20 04:32:05,depression

1jfgjwl,Longest I've gone without falling back into a depressive state. It's a lifelong war,"It's been a few months since I've felt this much hatred for myself. I recently fell sick again and I just cant help but hate living like this. Everyday I have to endure my family, my insecurities and my overall self-loathing. I'm turning 18 this year and it has only made me feel like I've lost my years to depression and anxiety. I'm a high school dropout with no job or skills, I have only one thing that I could possible pursue as a career and I used to love doing it, but I'm even losing interest in that. I stopped visiting the psychiatrist and stopped medication because I felt like it did nothing but exhaust me and make me feel less. Now all I do is rot in bed and wish i had a better life.

I was genuinely doing great for the past few months, but my lack of progress in fixing myself up like trying to put myself together and go out more often is devastating to me. I'm filled with jealousy and rage when I see people, especially girls my age doing great and being so put-together. Everything just felt like I was putting up a front for others subconsciously, but I genuinely felt happy for awhile. I guess my emotions hit me like a train today, and all I can really do is write about it and journal it.

I've vowed to stop putting this energy out into the world and into other people's lives because, at then end of the day, it's not anyone else's responsibility but mine to take care of myself. I just don't know why I relapsed so suddenly today, I don't self-harm or anything, my own mind hurts enough. 

It fills me with so much rage knowing that I'll never be able to truly live without depression, which makes me want to end things here and now. That temporary pain for me and my loved ones would be less than the amount of pain I'd probably bring them if I continued living. Feeling like an absolute burden to everyone. Falling sick every month, can't find a job for the life of me, can't even finish the extra school my parents are paying for (I chose to take a private course to do nails) I am just losing myself. All that on top of my struggle with religion. I truly want to do better, but knowing that I will never fully fulfil the goals I set for myself is what hurts me the most. Knowing that I'll always be fighting this war with depression throughout the rest of my life while I figure out adulthood as well, it all seems so daunting. I'm accustomed to failure at this point, so I don't even bother to pursue the things I love when I know I'll make mistakes or eventually fail.

Just this mind reset today made me realize that I will have to deal with this the rest of my life, despite how great I had been feeling.",2025-03-20 04:07:25,depression

I said about 960 months or 3084 weeks or 1.8 billion seconds etc. Brutal honesty here, I cannot live that long, not after experiencing nearly 21 years of misery. Not one single day has passed that I was fully happy.

I was born in a South Asian family, to an intensely misogynistic, selfish dad and a caring mom. I am no longer living with them but my childhood trauma still lingers but whatever it’s not that big of a deal. I am in college now and my grades are mid to be fair. I am pushing through this semester and it would be academically my best. Now guess what? I cannot afford tuition anymore because of fucking rent and a tuition increase from next semester. I cannot be homeless so I have to give up on my engineering dream and drop out. 

Now coming to a bit personal life. I have never fallen in love with anyone, never had a relationship or girlfriend. I did crush on a few ppl here and there. I also did ask out or try to ask out a few ppl but it was always met with a no. 

So after seeing so much darkness in my life so far and potentially more in the future what is there to live for? In my eyes the only solution is to just cut it short and d!e.",2025-03-20 03:38:08,depression

My mum has problems with her mental health and she thinks she gave it to me like it was hereditary but honestly I hate how I've become and don't see myself fit to even be seen with my family. Schools not any better either, I've become a lot more distant from my friends and my last relationship I completely ruined because I have avoidance attachment which I didn't even know about. I've been this way since I was 11, I started smoking and drinking beer because I wanted to be like my father but kept it a secret for years until I opened up to my parents and made my mum more stressed and she started smoking again and my dad just took the opportunity to make me his weed buddy. I already told them I wanted to kill myself but my mums new boyfriend said that ""I'm only doing it for attention"" and dad just called me a pussy and so now I don't even know if I want to do it because I'll be pictured as an a weak link in my family and that they wouldn't even care that I passed away,  but i don't want to stay this depressed and miserable.

I still think I’m overreacting because I have never been bullied before except a bit by my family. I don’t use alcohol or do drugs but showed symptoms for everything else I have stopped caring about my appearance for school I used to always try to do my makeup and hair and where different clothes but I stopped caring about my hair and then my clothes I just wore legging and a shirt for almost along time and then I stopped caring about makeup. It’s a struggle to even wake up and get ready and I stopped liking to go out and just stay and scroll on my phone. I stopped enjoying hanging out, watching movies and being with my family. I’m really scared I cry for no reason many times I just want this to end what did I do to deserve this I used to have suicidal really bad ones every night around 4 years ago and it slowly came back. What affected me the most was losing my spark between my friends from last year and one friend leaving me without a reason and having her in my class. My friends making fun on me for having no new friends it hurts I just hate this.

1jfeedj,I feel like I’m living a nightmare I can’t wake up from,"About 8 months ago, my girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me and it was bad. She had her family chase me out of the house as if I abused her or something when all I ever did was give them everything that I had. I did most of the chores, always paid what was expected of me, and when things got heavy, I would spend my last money to get her what she needed. My only sin was being depressed and socially awkward and unable to party with her family every day. 

I can’t go into detail about our relationship because it would be a novel but I felt it was mostly good except when her family and friends tried to butt in. I feel I was wronged so badly and there’s nothing I can do about. I tried so hard to make things work with her and do what I could and all it did was leave me even more broken than I thought possible. I feel like I can never love again and am never going to treat any woman good again because this whole experience has left me disillusioned and bitter with everything.

8 months have passed and it feels like I’m living in a constant nightmare. I go to work, come home, drink and smoke weed and try to sleep as long as I can on most days off. I have a few friends but our schedules don’t align and after dozens and dozens of attempts to hang out with them, I finally gave up. 

The thought of dating makes me sick, especially since every girl I swipe by is ugly compared to her. She was a really beautiful and although I’m physically attractive, I’m very socially awkward and don’t know how to talk to women. All women I’ve ever met were on online dating but I haven’t gotten a real match in 5+ years and I feel like I’m swiping left a lot more than right because most girls can’t hold a candle to her.

I don’t know what to do or how to feel better. I’m completely isolated other than my cat. I can’t do anything that’s recommended to get over a breakup like hanging out with friends or getting a rebound. I’m seeing a therapist but all she does is offer me the same optimistic cliches that aren’t necessarily true.

The only thing that’s been helping me keep it together is smoking weed but I’ll have to quit that to go into nursing school which scares the hell out of me because it’s the only thing that provides me with some semblance of pleasure. I’m not looking forward to nursing school or nursing because of the horror stories but I’m getting old and in this economy, you’re going to have to have a good job and I already spent so much time and effort making it this far, I can’t turn back. My hobby is playing drums and guitar but I can’t join a band because my days off are sun-tue and gigs only happen thur- sat. Plus, nursing school isn’t going to let me be in a band. 

I’ve been depressed my whole life but I used to look forward to the future. But now I’m old (35) and need testosterone supplements and 20mg of cialis to get hard. I don’t really have any thing to look forward to anymore so this sinking feeling I’ve had has just been constant. I used to go to the gym a lot but it never helped me with my mental health before. In fact, I got put on a 5150 while I was working out.

I keep feeling like I’ll wake up and I’ll get to see her and the cats again but I never do. I really don’t know what to do, this is such a horrible feeling to have all the time. I thought I’d felt down before many times in my life but this is different because I can’t find anything to be optimistic about. ",2025-03-20 02:09:29,depression

That whole night where I called and texted dozens of times because I thought she may have gotten hurt at the concert she was at since even past midnight her phone location was still there (her request to have one another’s locations), drove an hour to the venue at 2am, and found her reclined in her car with a guy she met at the show


Of course, there’s more to the story, including her turning off the emergency bypass ringtone (which was her idea to have in the first place) and texting me when I nearly pulled up to the venue that she was home safe, but those are the highlights


I still don’t know for a fact to this day whether she did cheat on me or not. I definitely think that she did, but I don’t have proof. I feel like I can’t tell a future partner “oh, I was cheated on” without definitive proof because then I’ll look bad for assigning the label of cheater without having concrete evidence, only circumstantial


But anyway, what even is trauma? I’m spiraling so hard as I write this. Whenever I get these waves of emotions, these images trapped in my head, I just feel broken. I feel traumatized? Does calling it trauma help with realizing the pain of it? Is it even significant enough to deem trauma, or am I just devaluing how significant of a word that is by feeling like I may have been? Am I just trying to give it to the worst word I can think of because it was one of the worst things anyone has done to me? Surely, I can’t have ever faced trauma in my life without having experienced significant abuse or a near-death experience (that isn’t a suicide attempt)? Is it really TRAUMA or just a difficult life moment? Both? Does it even fucking matter what it’s called? Why do I even care about a label? Will I ever be able to trust in a relationship again? Will I ever even process whatever the fuck this is?",2025-03-20 02:07:00,depression

I feel like an asshole I got married at what I would say a healthy time in my life this person is my dream person. I can't help but feel unworthy and that I deserve to be alone. I moved a ways a way from family. I feel so isolated that not even my family or partner is supportive of me when that is far from the truth. Somewhat recently and what has been sort of a problem my partner has lost trust of mine it has been devastating. All at the same time they have been communicating and seems like they been trying to mend said trust. I have problems of my own my drinking has been atrocious my past may be a result of it as a couple of times I've caused harm and worry to my partner bc of it. Thinking I was reliving my past.

I want to die but I don’t want to kill myself. I just don’t want to exist. There are times when I don’t feel depressed in the moment but I know it’s just bubbling beneath the surface. I get up not because I want to but because I feel like I have to and I hate doing things that I feel obligated to do; having children, getting married, living ??

I feel like I’ve been screaming for help and no one will help me. Do I have to get on my hands and knees and bag for someone to be my friend? Do I have to threaten to kill myself for someone to be my friend? I feel nothing. No one has truly ever been as alone as me. The only time I feel like people listen to me is when I complain online to complete strangers.

1jfdg2v,A wasted life,"I always excelled in school. Always the highest reading level, highest math scores. Never had to study for anything, it always just came naturally to me. Always had a decent social life in high school, was a member of a couple clubs and my school’s golf team. I never thought of myself as “happy” but I enjoyed life I guess. everything was okay. I ended up going to a lower end college because even though I was accepted to a bunch of great schools I couldn’t end up going to any of them. Story for another time. But at this school was a girl I had met for an orientation for the school a couple months before. She was in a relationship but we still became good friends. I was in love with her. We became closer and closer as friends and were eventually best friends, I was happy to know her at all but deep down I needed more. While all of this was going on, I continued to excel in school and put myself on track to graduate a year early, which I did last May. Eventually, this girl and I did become more than friends… not long after her longterm relationship ended. It was the best year+ of my life and the only time I’ve ever been truly and genuinely happy. Lost her last July, she left me for someone else. In the meantime, my life has collapsed and I’m convinced my life is going to be a total waste. I suck at my job because I have no level of focus (or quite honestly care, I don’t care about anything) and am perpetually exhausted. I’m severely depressed and mentally ill. 

I’m frustrated because my life had the opportunity to be so good. Many people would do anything for the position I ended up in. But I threw it away. My life has spiraled because of a girl and at this point I don’t see how I can dig out of this hole.

Every night that I go to sleep I hope I don’t wake up. The pain is too much to tolerate much longer. I feel myself getting physically weak too, I just hope it keeps happening so I can wither away and be forgotten. ",2025-03-20 01:22:06,depression

I was always struggling to find joy in anything but I was somehow still managing to find small happiness is small details but that's also gone. I've born and raised in eastern european country where everything is grey and depressed like Silent Hill world but at least there were people who I loved and enjoyed to be with but that people aren't with me anymore because I moved to USA in 2021 and I completely lost the communication to outside world. I work remotely and I have my own logistics company, I can't really say that I am depressed or sad because I need money, I've been broke and I've had money but I've always been emotionless and sad in both situations. I spend 18 hours out of 24 in my bed working and my average step count is max 300 a day. My lifestyle has left no toll about my physicality, I am 6'2, full in tattoos and more or less handsome. I've described myself because I wanted to make it clear that my physical body has nothing to do with my depression. I used to enjoy playing soccer, reading books or some scientistic articles, I used to study physics and programming in university but all the motivation is just gone, I don't see myself in the future and I am not looking forward to anything, I genuinely think nobody will ever be truly able to share a life with me. I am super comfort zone depended person and I never leave my comfort zone, every time I've tried it I hated myself and everyone around me, to force something to myself is out of option because it causes worse and worse consequences. Every day after I finish my job I just look at my computer screen and do nothing, I feel like a robot, I don't enjoy with playing video games anymore and I've seen hundreds of movies if not a thousand in my life and simply there aren't much movies left for me to watch since I have very picky taste in such things. I always thought su\*c\*de was not an option and I'll never ever thing about it, but I am also very tired to exist, not to live.

Of course, I don't have a chest or any visible pectorals. 

I work in an office and there are several girls I like and talk to regularly, but the thought of them seeing me in a t-shirt and losing all physical attraction to me terrifies me.

I'm trying to work out a bit but because of other mental problems like my negative thoughts, my anxiety disorder, my fear of people's stares, my lack of self-confidence and my lack of friends I can train with, it's going absolutely nowhere. 

Yesterday evening I was leaving the office when I saw a boy in another office wearing a T-shirt, more muscular than me and with a build I'd like to have, and it simply destroyed my self-esteem for the evening. The mere fact that these girls are probably going to compare me to him makes me want to d** and go far away.

I’ve been struggling a lot with depression and family issues lately.

Lately, I’ve felt so disconnected from my family and friends. I don’t want to talk to anyone, and every time someone enters my room, it feels like they’re disturbing my peace. I’ve started withdrawing more and more, and I’m not sure how to cope with it. I don’t know how to get out of this headspace where everything feels so dark and lonely.

1jfcah2,Feel trapped and depressed living at home,"I’m currently a university student and my biggest biggest regret is not choosing a university with cheaper accommodation and living out. I live at home with my siblings and my parents. It’s a three bedroom house and I sleep on a bunk bed at my big age and share with my sister. I always mention to my parents how I want to move out but get told that I’d be disowning them if I left and how a female shouldn’t live alone. Or they suggest that if I’m willing to pay extortionate rent, why can’t I just pay them. I can’t try out new styles because there’s no space to buy new clothes and I can’t even fit a desk so I have a makeshift exam type table. It’s getting to the point where I just feel depressed and so stunted. Everyone I see at university seems so happy and carefree while I feel like all the happiness i once had is lost. There’s so many issues at home and I just feel like my university experience has been ruined by not living out. I’d keep justifying it by thinking about being able to save up but it’s getting to the point where I feel like I can’t breathe. I end up binge eating and I feel like I can’t become my best self if I’m trapped at home.

I could not wake up tomorrow and no one would ever notice. I have no friends or family. If I ever talk to them I have to reach out first most of the time. That’s  if I haven’t been sent to voicemail first. 

I’m living everyday with no purpose. I grew up in an abusive household growing up then was kicked out as a teen so I’ve always looked for love in girls and friends that just used me. Im always giving and get nothing in return. I’ve given people a place to stay, loaned money, I’m the type of person if I have you have it. But I’m on the brink of homelessness and I can’t even get a call back or any help. My job is doing layoffs and they reduced my pay without notice. My dad pockets 6 figures after all expenses but he doesn’t want to help(never gave me a large sum of money before either). My mom is vacationing in France while I barely have money to eat. My “friends” won’t even take 2 minutes to listen to my music I send. Music is my passion and  I am slowly falling out of love with it because I’m too depressed to do anything. I barely want to leave the house, I can barely even get out of bed unless I’m going to work. Life feels so pointless, I thought it gets better at some point but it doesn’t. I come home to nothing and nobody. I smoke flowers but it’s not even cutting it, fortunately I’ve been around junkies and that keeps me from hard stuff but it’s tempting. I could just use a hug or even a good convo with someone that ACTUALLY gives a damn. I should be excited that I got a new job that I start next week. It’s in sales and they are going to pay me what I was making before my pay reduction and I have potential to make way more in commission but I can’t even put a fake smile on my face to talk to people all day. I could really use the position but I have a sinking feeling that things just aren’t going to get better. I haven’t genuinely smiled in years. I can’t remember that last time things were just OK -not good, not great, but just ok. No tears, no depression. much rather pull the plug instead of continuing this endless cycle where think there’s hope, I almost make it where I need to be, then boom I’m back at square one.

I just wanted to take a moment to remind anyone struggling that you’re not alone. Mental health challenges can feel isolating, but there are people who genuinely care and want to support you. Whether you’re dealing with anxiety, depression, stress, or just feeling overwhelmed, it’s okay to reach out.

If you ever need a safe space to talk, there’s an app called **Kuky** that connects people going through similar struggles. It’s a judgment-free platform where you can share your thoughts, find companionship, and talk with others who truly understand. Sometimes, just having someone to listen can make a difference.

Take things one day at a time. You are valued, you matter, and you deserve support. 💙

1jflm1a,I feel scared I'm stepping boundaries all the time,"I'm not the most important person in the world to anyone. I know that, and I'm trying to accept this. I have gone through therapy and it has helped. I have a lot of acquaintances now and I maintain good boundaries with them. 
The tough part is that I had a lot of people being the most important thing in my lives at some point. I have an anxious attachment style. I know the stereotypes but I fit very well in all that was wrong with it. I worked on it and work more on self care now.
The problem arises in drawing the line. I respect everyone's boundaries. I have never been someone who hurts anyone so I keep doing that , unless I have to confront someone which is new. Even then it's not intentional but people get hurt with confrontation often. I try to sugar coat , but it still hurts them I guess. It's not a positive subject after all.
I was going through my mom's old photos today. I don't feel that anyone can love me like she has. It's true. She has gone through insane abuse but kept us shielded and loved us always and cared for us too much. I guess it would be true for a lot of people. But I'm not very important to her, and I know that. My elder sister is much closer to her because my mom feels they have less age gap and she understands more things than I do about what she went through. I'm 30 now , but I guess I will always be the younger one to her. I have had many scenarios where my sister ( who had sexually abused me as a kid ) was supported by my mom. I told my mom once I grew up but I'm not sure she believes it or wants to acknowledge it because I hardly am in touch with my sister now anyway. I know my mom has also hurt me sometimes when she supports my sister in cases where  she is clearly wrong, but I guess she is the only person who has helped me through tough times and taken care of me when I was sick. She is the only person who will respond to my texts when she sees them, so she is the most important I guess. I have a lot of fun on trips that only she and I go on. We cover so many interesting things and it's nice. She's my friend. 
I felt questioning myself today when I was sending some old photos of hers to her wondering if it would seem creepy that I was looking at old photos of her. So I made a joke about it. I feel frustrated having to hide behind humour.
I constantly worry that I come across as creepy. A lot of times when I'm talking to people they don't respond correctly to me and try to avoid running into me. I never say anything wrong in my perspective, tried to think a lot over it. I guess I'm just quirky and my delivery of sentences is a bit awkward because I am a socially awkward person, battling depression who is trying to interact with people to help out of depression. 
Everywhere people hate me for being too caring. If I ask often how they are when they are sick,they eventually get distant. i don't evade on their space I think. It's just texts. Maybe it's not related, the two things....but yes, I guess I have to always drink and party with people so they think I am cool. And then I feel bad the next day because I didn't want to share all that I ended up sharing in that drunk moment.

I have an acquaintances now, I think...that I think could be friends....but I'm too scared to text her often because I think I will violate her boundaries or creep her out. I try texting once in a while. I don't understand the world anymore I think. ",2025-03-20 10:15:57,mentalhealth

In this relationship he has told me about…well sexual stuff like positioning, orgasm, etc. which I, as an immature child have found funny. He has also send me furry pornography. Not only that he also made me do sexual things like moaning. It got more and more extreme and now I‘m starting to think that he was using my immaturity and naivety to make me do said sexual things.

I couldn’t break up with him earlier because he told me that he was going to kill himself if I did and he told me that he was mentally ill (depressed, autistic, schizophrenic, etc.)

There was also an incident where he lied to me about some people blackmailing him and planning to kill him. Then he wanted to kiss me even though I felt uncomfortable and didn’t stop asking until I actually did. There was another incident where he sent me a video about two people dancing romantically on TikTok and when I said I didn’t want to do that he started insulting me.

He also started to isolate me from my friends to the point that I only had him. 

The sexual things got extreme to the point that he wanted to pull me by his necklace like he was a dog and I felt extremely uncomfortable by doing so but I simply couldn’t say no because he told me about his mental illnesses. Then when he was kissing me I was also uncomfortable but I still didn’t say no to that. Sometimes I backed off but he always was begging me until I agreed. 

Thankfully I never slept with him though.

Now I‘m starting to think that he was using me but on the other hand I see much worse stories online. I don‘t know what to think.

I mostly think I am overreacting because I had an addiction to pornography at the time.

Now I also get awfully sad when I think about stuff that reminds me of him. I‘m literally holding my tears while writing this.

Can someone give me advice? Am I overreacting?",2025-03-20 09:46:29,mentalhealth
1jfl5ih,Lying to skip work because of my mental health struggles,"Lately I have never felt more the need to skip work because I am going through a lot.

I have to lie and fake that I am sick physically.

that stresses me out, I wish I could tell the truth but my boss doesn’t really get those things and might see them as an excuse to not get the work done.

I am very much feeling terrible, i found myself multiple times hiding in the bathroom crying, and I am aware that I will not be understood. 

So I hate it, but I need to lie in order to do some self care towards myself and my struggles.

How is this possible? I am an italian living in italy and here seems, it’s not very normalized to not go to work because you’re feeling sick mentally, (at least where I work).

Sorry for any incorrect grammar, english as you can see isnt my main language.

1jfkyj1,"For the first time in my life, I feel like things won’t ever get better","I have always been a somewhat positive person. The “Things won’t always be this bad, the best is yet to come“ type, the “I know who I am and what I want to do in my life” type. But now, in my mid-twenties, graduated a few months ago and struggling to find a job, with parents going through a rough divorce, and making me feel like the worst person on Earth as I have no income and no way to help anyone financially. I feel like a disappointment, like an outcast, like the life I always wanted to live is slipping through my fingers slowly. I know this is a difficult age, I know I’m not the first person to go through this, but damn, why is it so hard ?

1jfkn60,"I'm holding myself back. I feel left behind, unqualified, and like a failure","It's 3am and I can't sleep over the fact that I feel like a failure. In spite of the achievements and talents I hold I always feel like I come short. Also, I worry of not meeting people's expectations if I were to apply myself to the things I want in life. 

One of those is my art. I've always wanted to be an artist since I was 16, now 25m, and my ex was an an artist of sorts too. He spent 8 years drilling insecurities into me. He never had time for my art, he always talked about his and his backstories. Then it was tracing, which is bad to pass that off as your own, but essential for when you're learning to draw. He'd take beef with artists he believed were tracing and some of them got cancelled over it which reinforced my fears. Im an insecure person, and the thought of someone calling my art out and/or cancelling me is scary.

Even though he around anymore, it still affects me. It gives me so much anxiety when I draw. I'll avoid drawing by doing other things, or if I try sometimes I'll freeze. When I freeze, I feel a disconnect followed by increasing self-doubt. It used to apply to commission work, where Id fall behind after a few weeks. But for a while I've had the same feeling towards personal work. I cringe at ALL my work and I feel ""unqualified"" to draw because I didn't study it at school. It's irrational and yet it controls me. I also struggle looking at some artists because I get jealous and depressed. Some of them were ones I used to like but my ex had beef with them, the others were budding artists at times I tried to get back into it but have since blossomed. Those hurt the most because I feel like I've fallen behind. How do they get it? Why do I think I'm not good enough? I need to fix this, I'm just wasting time! I know change takes time but I'm so fed up with feeling this way. Art has been a huge struggle for me the last 6 years or so but it's so personal I can't give it up.",2025-03-20 09:05:09,mentalhealth
1jfkbbc,Have you ever realized way too late that someone close was manipulating you?,"I’ve been struggling with something for a while, and I wonder if others have been through the same.

Manipulation is terrifying because it never feels like manipulation when you’re in it. It’s so subtle, so deeply ingrained in your reality, that by the time you finally see the truth, it shakes you to your core. The betrayal hits hard, and after that, trusting people feels almost impossible.

For me, it was my cousin. Someone I had known for 24 years—my entire life. I trusted her completely, never once questioning her intentions. But looking back, I see how deeply she influenced me, how she shaped the way I saw myself, how she slowly chipped away at my confidence. Realizing the truth at 24 was heartbreaking. I kept wondering: How did I not see it earlier? How much of my life was shaped by her manipulation? And the worst part? She never admitted to it, never took responsibility, and even when we lost contact, she still tried to pull me back in.

I know I’m not alone in this, and I want to hear from others who’ve been through it.
	•	How did you finally realize you were being manipulated?
	•	How long did it take you to break free?
	•	Did your manipulator ever confront you, or did they keep trying to pull you back?
	•	How did you learn to trust again after experiencing such deep betrayal?

If any of this resonates with you, I’d really appreciate hearing your story. I want to learn from those who’ve been through this, and maybe, in sharing, we can help each other heal.",2025-03-20 08:39:03,mentalhealth
1jfk2ww,Do I Have a Mental Condition? (Need Insight),"Hey, I’m struggling a lot mentally, and I’ve been trying to figure out what’s wrong with me. I don’t want to self-diagnose, but I feel like I have real issues that are affecting my life. I’d appreciate any insights from people who have gone through similar things or have experience with mental health.

My Symptoms & Struggles:
	•	Extreme mood swings – I can feel confident and powerful one moment, then completely worthless the next, multiple times a day.
	•	Emotional outbursts – Sometimes I get really angry or aggressive without wanting to, and I regret it later.
	•	Self-worth issues – I either see myself as better than others or completely trash. No in-between.
	•	Identity confusion – I don’t know who I really am, what I like, or what my personality is.
	•	Overanalyzing everything – I think deeply about every small action, to the point where life feels unnatural and disconnected.
	•	Paranoia & hypervigilance – I feel like people might betray me or have hidden intentions.
	•	Fear of intimacy – I find it hard to express love, even to my girlfriend. Sometimes I cringe at closeness.
	•	Cutting people off easily – If someone hurts me even slightly, I instantly want to drop them from my life.
	•	Dissociation & numbness – I feel detached from reality at times, like I’m watching life from a distance.
	•	Lack of discipline & motivation – I struggle with school, focusing, and getting things done, even though I want to improve.
	•	Self-sabotage – When things go well, I mess them up, and I don’t know why.
	•	Deep trauma & family issues – My father is extremely controlling and emotionally abusive. He gaslights me, threatens me, and denies all responsibility. My mother shifts between understanding me and siding with my father. But he talks at times normal and says i just need a group structure that will makw disciplined or sum?
	•	Repressed childhood stress – I don’t remember huge parts of my past, but I know I was mistreated emotionally.",2025-03-20 08:19:54,mentalhealth
1jfjsp3,I'm so alone,"My birthday is on Friday and I'll be turning 29. 
To most people birthdays feel happy and are something worth celebrating, for me no so much. Having another year around the sun solidifies time and in return brings me closer to my self appointed expiration date. 
Normally, I would talk about my birthday coming up in the months previous to my birthday And then be radio silent the month of my birthday. 
This year tho, was the complete opposite. 
When I was in my 20's I had multiple attempts and that's when I set the expiration date.
Here it is 10 years later and for my birthday, I'm the one that made the plans, I'm the one that's paying for everyone, I'm the one doing the things I shouldn't have to.

1jfjsb9,Anxiety has ruined my world and my self-perception. Is there any way out of this rut?,"Looking for instances/tips as to how to get over crippling anxiety. I used to be a very hardworking student in lawschool who scored a decent GPA despite my struggles with depression and anxiety, and going without internet for 3 quarters of the pandemic. I used to get burnt out during each semester of lawschool but still managed to push on with internships and other co-curricular activities. 

However, I completely fumbled my first job; I got massive anxiety attacks while on the job, and in the aftermath, my cognitive abilities including attention span, reading comprehension, working memory, etc declined. I had to quit my job owing to my performance and the fact that I had become extremely suicidal. I am trying to ""rebuild"" the skills I had at the moment. But I seem to have become really demotivated and exhausted. Earlier, as an intern, I had no problem putting int 9-12 hours or even more at work. Right now, I dread that and crave some work-life balance. I seem to have lost a lot of the interest I had in law, and struggle sometimes to even recollect basic concepts that I had mastered over the past 5 years. 

Are these changes temporary or permanent? I am on meds and therapy right now but will I ever get back my zeal for law and the ability to work long hours? Anxiety and consequent depression seem to have cast a shadow over my life and my perception of it, and I am feeling dreadfully dejected these days. There seems to be no way out right now and I have been harbouring suicidal ideations.",2025-03-20 07:56:15,mentalhealth

1jfj8gu,I’ve never felt normal and I’m confused on where to go from here,"Since I was young I never really felt normal, I never made friends or even when I did make friends they didn’t last. I always thought that when I got into college things would be different because I’d have ample opportunity to go out but instead I’ve just become more and more reclusive, it’s gotten to a point where I dread going out and dread class time.

1jfj484,I have no life,"In the sense that I have no current prospects without the help of others and that I have likely repressed the vast majority of my life I have almost no life to speak of. I’ve self sabotaged in school and can’t find a single job after getting fired for a pretty dumb reason.

I’m 18 and I had a pretty bad life (ACE score of 6) which I didn’t reconcile with at the time because I didn’t have a different frame of reference and physical abuse was quite minimal (though there were also threats slightly more commonly). I’ve been poorly behaved but competent in my classes until I had to reconcile with what my life had been up to that point. I had a sibling press charges against my step father for repeated sexual assault and realizing just how horrible he was was a big realization. Somehow I managed to pass my classes I had that year but a couple months into the next school year my insomnia worsened and I’m relatively sure I had clinical depression. I don’t know how I consistently made it to work on time but I stopped showing up to school, would fall asleep for a couple hours in the middle of the day, had very inconsistent eating patterns and spent most of my time in bed. I had the credits to graduate but I don’t have the grades to make it into post secondary and can’t take auxiliary classes without money Luckily I did manage to get over my depression and I was working overtime but blew my money on a pc shortly before getting fired

As for my work, I worked in fast food and I got suspended a year before I got fired because a coworker shoved me and told me he’d beat my ass and I told him “do it then. Beat my ass” which due to it being a response to a violent altercation counts as harassment under their bullshit policy. Since I was already suspended I got fired for saying “oh, fuck off” under my breath when told by one of the managers to get off my phone. I was 100% in the wrong in that situation but it does seem unfair because for months I was constantly doing the work of at least two people, constantly taking overtime and because I was cross trained I’d often be expected to work multiple sections of the store at once. I very briefly had a therapist and even she was genuinely surprised that I was fired over that and thought it was unfair.

It’s been 7 months since I’ve been fired and I am entirely broke. I have to entirely rely on my mother who I should clarify is wonderful and was more of a victim than I am but who I hate to leech off of. I have not been able to find a single job in those seven months despite applying to everywhere I could and I’ve only gotten one interview. I don’t have a license so I have especially limited opportunities (even if I did I don’t have the money for gas or a car). I’ve also failed to keep in contact with the people I used to be friends with since being fired.

On top of that though not as related, I can not remember almost anything when I was 14 or younger. There’s a few random memories but I don’t even have a timeframe for them and can’t say how they inform who I am all that much. Even more recent years huge gaps are missing. I do not remember a single teacher from grade 10, for example.

In every sense but literal I don’t have a life to speak of. I don’t remember my lived experiences well at all and even if I knew what I wanted to do I can’t achieve any aspirations or make any forward progress without luck that I haven’t had the past 7 months.",2025-03-20 07:03:18,mentalhealth

1jfii9c,hmmm hear me out pls?,"I'm 17. Between 16 and 18, I was supposed to enjoy being 17, but how could I when I'm in between enjoying youth and also preparing to be an adult. 

I've skipped school twice this month, not because of extracurricular activities but because I felt like I can't do it anymore. Help, I feel like I'm not me anymore. I feel like I'm losing myself. School is tough, as expected because this is the top school in my city. It takes me an hour to commute. Why did I even choos

I wasn't bright during my elementary days, but a sudden spark occured and I peaked during Junior High. It felt great, being somebody my parents could be proud of, being somebody my cousins can look up to, being somebody people say greetings to, being somebody worth celebrating. But being someday to everyone is tiring. Slowly, before I could even taste the fruit of my labor, came the price of greatness. Suddenly, I felt like a bare statue. Everyone's eyes are pressing onto me. Their mouths sing the same tune of pleasantries but their eyes hold an expectation that I have to uphold. Afterall, a statue is meant to stay the same forever, immobile, unable to speak. I feel like shattering, but how could I when I am something to everybody?

Looking back, I spent sleepless nights doing homeworks, locked in for exams, working endlessly for clubs, everything felt good and is heading in one direction. Senior high came, same routine, different outcomes, I spent sleepless nights for homeworks that didn't even reach 75% mark, locked in for exams that barely passed my standard, still working endlessly for organization. I was distracted at first, but being the person I am, I noticed that I was not keeping up with the people around me. My frustrations reflected my actions and I unconsciously projected my insecurities to the people around me. I started being irritated by my friend who skips school, telling off my seatmate who can't keep up with the class but still chill, I hated them for doing something I wouldn't do. 

I tried every means of surviving, my emotions were automatically put on the backburner. I stayed distracted for about 3 quarters of my 11th grade. Alas, the 4th quarter came. I didn't know I was burning out, but there were signs. But if you were a 17 year old, lost in a big city more than an hour away from your home, surrounded by people you can't bear having around, barely keeping a great academic performance, would you even have the time to think about it?

Slowly, I felt like I was losing my self worth. I have great friends who look out for me, but I always dismiss the attempt to ask for help, because who am I to burden them? 

It felt like I was walking aimlessly despite having a clear destination in mind. Turns out I'm not hating them for doing things I wouldn't do, I hate the fact that they could do something I couldn't do. Every hour down to the last seconds of the days I didn't go to school, my guilt eats up my mind. 

I ought to be the person who cheers on others, but how can I when I can't even cheer myself. 

I just feel so down seeing everyone trying and I couldn't keep up. Do I invalidate my feelings or am I really this useless?

Writing all these down made me feel a bit lighter:< I've been looking for somebody to talk with but I'm afraid that I might trouble them for nothing. Thank you for listening:>

I always think people can read my mind. I have to backtrack my thoughts to convince myself I’m a good person. It’s always good vs evil. Sometimes I worry that somebody can see me in the bath through a hidden camera. When I hear a song I think that my brain is creating the music and that it is displaying or “programming” my thoughts. That somehow I am behind everyone else in the 3D world and they have reached enlightenment, that I need to “wake up”. I am not religious. I don’t do any substances. When I’m outside in the dark, I can see the shadows forming and it looks like my cat running through a yard. I convince myself that it’s true, that if I don’t believe it’s real my cat won’t come home. I’m exhausted. I cry almost every night being so overwhelmed. I can’t get enough sleep anymore, and when I do get “good” sleep it’s well over 8 hours and I’m still so tired. I’ll close my eyes and see those shapes of white in the dark and think that it’s the “truth”, “home” whatever. I think that dreams are taking me somewhere else. A lot of things feel like a sign.

Weird sensations like sometimes my arms get hot and waking up my hands feel like they are full of adrenaline which just wakes me up and then it’s fine.

I have nobody, every single day I have to struggle on my own, I've become so insecure that at school I don't want anybody even seeing my face so I just hide in the washroom stall when there isn't class. I just want to be normal, I've tried everything, seriously. This is nobody's fault but my own honestly if I was born mentally well and mentally stable then nobody would find me weird. I can't even bring myself to empathize with anybody anymore because of how badly I've been mistreated my entire life.

1jfhukr,I'm really struggling lately and need some advice.,"I, 29f, have been struggling pretty bad the last year and a half with poor mental health. I dug my life into the ground and paid the price. I started slowly improving my life little by little but lately it's gotten do bad. I'm heart broken, self harming so much so that I can't put on pants/ can barely walk right now. I had to go on fmla today at work because I just can't function. I came closer last night to ending my life than I ever have. It got really scary for me. Today's not much better.

Where I live now, I have a huge support system filled with amazing people who want good things for me. Ove been here 4.5 years and have enjoyed it. So many beautiful friends and acquaintances who add value to my life. The downfall with this social life is it has gotten me to a place where I'm also abusing alcohol and substances a lot and that's something else I'm struggling with and is also playing a role in my bad mental health. 

My mom, who I'm very close with, lives in the Midwest. And after learning about my struggles, she wants me to move back and live with her for awhile and try to maybe get help there. She has room for me in her home and I eiuldnt have to worry about too much. I'm torn because part of me thinks that may be a good route for me to go. It could save my life. It may give me the opportunity to get clean and figure out how to handle these emotions better. Buy I'd lose physical contact with my friends. Of course we could stay in touch but it's not the same. Even if I only go for maybe 6 months. It still puts me in the position to risk those connections and that's scary for me. Moving also will screw me over financially, more than I am now. But again it could save me. I really don't know the right choice and i don't know if moving would be more helpful or hurtful. I'm scared of myself recently and I worry what will happen if I stay on this path. What would you do if you were in my position?",2025-03-20 05:30:28,mentalhealth

My coworker responded to my email to me coming clean about lying to her and she thanked me and showed support for me working on getting better. I did not lose my job (I am still on edge about it). I feel like I deserved to lose my job, I don’t feel worthy of forgiveness or sympathy for what I did to her.

My therapy session for today was rescheduled for next week and it sent me into a slight spiral. I thought to myself that this was a sign from the universe that I was a lost cause.

As of now I did a therapy worksheet I found online and have been reading through subreddits for encouragement. I am hoping to find a therapy session sooner than next week but we will see.",2025-03-20 05:30:19,mentalhealth

To keep it short my cousin ghosted me for around a year, and now he wants to “fix things”

Well I don’t know if I want to. I mean how can you ghost your own cousin accidentally? You know, unless it’s on purpose, either way I wasn’t in his mind.

Now the problem is his family is forcing my family to make me fix things, and my family is heavily favouring him.
Now even though what he did was wrong (it made it worse that I had no friends I just had graduated during this time)
I’m seen as the bad guy now because I don’t want to fix things, so now if I forgive him I’m basically doing a disservice to myself because I don’t want that energy with me but I got no other choice, except one.

This stresses me often and I think I’m gonna do something stupid at first it’s I would just break his phone pretty things but this isolation period really messed my mind up.

1jfhudc,Why was I cursed with these thoughts? and not anyone else I know?,"18M, Hi, so ever since October of 2024 i’ve been in pure pure despair. I think about death and suicide everyday; and no one I know can relate. It seems out of everyone, only I have these and they (everyone else) were gifted with bliss, peace and joy while I was cursed by God or the universe to be depressed, joyless, suicidal. I fantasize about doing it, very very often to the point where I have a whole plan on how I would do it, though I haven’t done it yet. My plan would be to get away from my parents who I love and my siblings, and go to another city. Then book a hotel room and just end it. It’s not fair, 17 years of my life was spent well, I was happy. Now I can’t even remember how that feels, and If I keep living the ratio of my bad years will outweigh the good, and I just don’t wanna ruin it. Funny thing is I thought everyone did this, but they don’t - it’s just me and other people who have been cursed. There is no escape from this, damned if I live and then my memory of myself would be this self-loathing and self-hating person. I’d rather if I die that my memory would be of me as a kid, where I was happy and loved everyone and everything. 

I heard death is like sleep, and *dying* is like falling asleep. Sleep is the only thing I enjoy nowadays, so it doesn’t seem so bad. It’s going to happen anyways right? Sorry for this rambling, just some thoughts I want to put out. ",2025-03-20 05:30:06,mentalhealth

But I'm terrified of this thought. I don't wanna lose this passion because I don't have anything else to live for. I'm too smart to not go into something that will benefit society. I don't want to be unsuccessful but the thought of me being successful is causing this anxiety-like feeling

1jfhjq1,I discovered something today. Is this a coincidence?,"From my childhood, I have always had the realization that my life starts to become worse from the month of June in any given year. I have always perceived Augusts to be the worst, and I always feel anxious something bad will happen in life.  I have noticed it will become better around December. I would be happy from the months of December to May. I thought it's something to do with the Christmas/New Year holidays lifting up the mood, that continues up until June.

Tonight, I just randomly found an online climatic map. You can adjust months and hover over the map to find temperatures, precipitations, cloud cover etc. I just found that the cloud cover where I grew up is 75% in June and consistently higher up until November. It drops to 45% in December and lowers from there until June. Coinciding with my perception of which months I feel good/bad in my life.

I moved to an entirely different place, now in the upper Midwest region of United States. This place is notorious for being cloudy in the Winter. March falls in my typical happy range of Dec-Jun. But I'm still down. Demotivated to do anything. So it's all about cloud cover from the beginning? I really hope it'll get better when Spring arrives here.",2025-03-20 05:10:10,mentalhealth

Here's the thing, I'm doing better currently I don't feel I'm that deep into depression and there have been gigantic changes, starting martial arts, a new hobby, getting my driver's license and being more stable mentally although I have my lows every month, I thought it had something to do with my menstrual cycle but those lows/blues don't match with any part of my menst. cycle phases so idk whats going on.

Besides those lows I feel overwhelmed/burnt out easily and get tired and discouraged easily, for example, I started doing MA in October and I haven't attended since February because I feel so unmotivated, I don't drive my car alone because I'm anxious and overthink about parking, but if I'm accompanied by anyone driving I can normally drive like its cake. Im quite lonely, don't have many friends I'm trying to work on it but currently, I'm quite alone.

I feel helpless and hopeless and unmotivated, every time I get excited about anything my motivation is short-lived, sometimes I have energy rushes when I start working out/exercising and I'm super motivated, clean the house, prepare plans for a healthy diet and it's like I'm about to start a routine and then pufff down again, I also have this physical feeling of heaviness in my legs, like when you take a hot bath or spend too much time in a pool, and get out of the water and your legs feel heavy af, well I have that feeling constantly through my body its like a mix of heaviness and weakness (idk if its allowed, but if anyone thinks its a medical condition and you can say it please say it so I can get checked for that specifically because doctors tend to dismiss symptoms where I live, which also discourages my from going to an appointment, I have been checked previously and dismissed) 

I also started gaining weight I'm not even obese but I'm starting to get chunky, clothes now feel uncomfortable, I tend to binge eat and it's making me even sadder.I don't even know if its actual weight or bloating.

I don't have any motivation partially because every time I pour my heart into a project I never see any results. If there is, every single time it benefits anyone but me (yeah people take advantage of me every time I work my ass off for something), so my motivation usually is short-lived as I constantly remember and feel like I do everything in vain so why bother.

I don't know what to do I feel like a stupid parasite,I cant keep up with a routine or anything and that heavines sensation is awful, is like gravity is calling my ass to sit down and do nothing. Also, the feeling of loneliness is dreading.

my therapists just don't seem to know what to do with me. they always clam up when i talk about my more serious problems and it makes me feel incredibly awkward. they've never known how to handle the DID so it's completely untreated and actively ruining my life. 

my current therapist is the ""your past doesn't define you"" kind, which i agree, but my past has also shaped me as a person. if we took the abuse out of the equation i would be entirely different. it's not really possible to ignore PTSD flashbacks, they feel like they're attacking you mentally. 

and i can't ignore my dissociation. i can blink & it'll be a day or two later and i could be injured or in some kind of trouble. i haven't stopped feeling depersonalized in years. it's not so simple as a breathing exercise or journaling, as much as i wish it was.

i've done DBT on my own and i noticed a way bigger change than what i'm currently doing (seriously, does journaling make the flashbacks go away?) but i can't really quit therapy for abusive situation reasons. maybe it's secretly helping and i'm just being a jerk.

1jfgexk,Help please,"Two years ago, at the age of 18, I had my first boyfriend. We were together for 9 months, but I didn’t tell my parents about the relationship. My mom eventually found out when she took my phone from me without permission and read our private messages. In those messages, we had discussed intimate topics and shared pictures. I deeply regret it now and forgive myself because I wasn’t fully aware of my actions at the time. However, my ex-boyfriend never misused the situation; he truly cared about me, and I loved him too.

Since then, my mom has believed that I slept with him, even though I didn’t. I’m afraid of going to the gynecologist because, years before this relationship, I inserted a finger and experienced bleeding for one day. I fear the doctor might say I’m not a virgin, which isn’t related to my ex-boyfriend.

For the past two years, my mom has been verbally abusive, calling me terrible names like “worthless,” “ugly,” and even telling me to “die.” She says no one will ever want me, that I’ve destroyed my value, and that God won’t forgive me. She has even told my relatives about what happened, and they stopped talking to me for a long time.

At one point, I didn’t have a phone for two months, which affected my studies because everything is online. Teachers noticed something was wrong, but I told everyone I was fine. On the outside, people think everything is okay, but my life feels like it’s falling apart.

I’ve thought about ending my life a few times because I feel like I have no one to turn to. I want to move on and heal, but my mom constantly brings up my past and prevents me from doing so. I need help but don’t know where or how to get it. My mental health is deteriorating, and I don’t know how much more I can take.

1jfg6hf,My friend is hopelessly depressed and only has me to rely on. I feel like he's not trying and I can't handle it anymore. What do I do?,"I *really* need help and advice here. I know this is quite long, so if you read it, thankyou so much.

I (29F) love my friend (29M) but I can't handle his hopelessness anymore, and I'm starting to feel really resentful towards him (which makes me feel horribly guilty). We've been friends for 9 years, throughout which he has struggled with depression and trauma. I have too, deeply, so I get it, and through hard work I have healed a lot. I've always been there to support him, but over the last year he has cut off almost all his friends, and now solely relies on me for social connection and support. I'm the only person he trusts and talks to honestly, and he felt like none of his other friends really understood him, which he was very resentful about. I can't help thinking, of course they didn't understand him, because he didn't open up to them, and this is a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy of isolation. 

  
He is very, very set in the belief that happiness and connection are impossible for him, and that he shouldn't have to try or hope for a happy life. About a year ago, we were living together, and I felt like I was the only thing that made him happy and that he was codependently relying on me to be his life buoy. We argued, and I told him he needed to prioritise his own happiness in order to heal. He replied that not caring about his own happiness is fundamental to who he is, and issued an ultimatum: if I wanted to be his friend, I had to accept that about him. I didn't want to stop being friends - I really care about him, and honestly, I was worried about how he would cope without me - but after a year of accepting these terms, I feel completely exhausted, hopeless, burdened and (recently) really angry with him. 

I don't live with him anymore but I am still the only person he is really friends with. He lives alone and is making no effort to make friends or go to therapy. He finds logical reasons to justify these things, but I can't help but think he just doesn't want to face the fear, shame, vulnerability and possible rejection/failure that may come with trying to build himself a good life/community and working on himself and his unresolved trauma.

  
I've been trying to set boundaries with him, only giving what I can give etc, but last week I reached my breaking point. He told me that he will never be able to be happy and that connection is simply not possible for him - as if depression and isolation are his identity. Later he asked to move in with me, because it would be good for *his* mental health, assuming I'd say yes and without even considering how I would feel. Suddenly, I was completely furious. I feel like he feels so entitled to codependently rely on me, and thinks that as long as he has me he can cope with the rest of his life being incredibly hopeless and miserable. He doesn't seem to consider or care about the impact this has on me, though I have told him before how stressed and grieved I am over his refusal to seek help. I can't stop being angry, and at this point what I actually want is not to see him anymore. I feel like his reliance on me is holding him back and frankly I'm just sick of it. I feel like he is being selfish in asking me to stick around and watch him rot in misery forever. However, I'm genuinely worried about what will happen if I am honest with him and say I need a break, which would leave him entirely alone. What do I do? ",2025-03-20 03:45:40,mentalhealth

I talked to my therapist about it, and she said I may have a generalized anxiety disorder, but it seemed like she didn't really want to pursue a diagnosis for anything for me. I said my reason for wanting a diagnosis was mainly just to feel like there was a reason behind the patterns and ways that I think and things that I feel. Not as an excuse, but just to recognize that there is a reason behind it, and it's not fair to compare myself to people without these types of concerns, and that I can give myself grace.

And I did bring it up like “guys, sorry I think I’m just in a bad mood and I’m taking it out on you. It feels like I don’t have a filter when I talk anymore”, and they say that it could just be that I feel really comfortable around them because I trust them.

I’ve been just feeling like a bad person. And when they joke back, I feel more sensitive than usual.

I also just kinda feel like my life is uninteresting. I don’t know exactly what to do to make me feel like a successful person anymore. In hindsight, I went to a good college, I have a job where I make slightly above average than most people my age. But I just feel unfulfilled. I feel like I don’t understand what the point of life is. I’m working to just be able to afford things I don’t care about? I don’t want to do anything. I don’t have goals rn. I’m not looking forward to anything. And sometimes I’ll snap out of it and feel happy but I feel like lately I’m more on autopilot than I am being grateful and happy about life.

I have a therapist, I will tell her about. I guess I just don’t know/expect her to help me with this. How can she possibly make me feel happier. I guess I just wanted to know how other people feel about this.",2025-03-20 03:22:30,mentalhealth

1jffp5c,I can't relax unless I'm completely alone.,"I'm not sure why. Other people stress me out, even if they're not doing anything. I still live with my family and I can never ever relax. It's hard to sleep, be productive, and focus on things. On the very rare occasion that everyone is out of the house I almost collapse into my bed and knock out. When I was a kid I'd ""pretend"" to be sick just so I could sleep during the day while everyone was gone. I was  never actually sick but I was so exhausted I basically was. I always refused to do group work with other students and if I could, I'd do my school work in a separate room. I shared a room with my younger sister and we'd get into fights all the time because I wanted to be alone. I wish I could get my own place and be away from everyone. Its not like I hate them, they just stress me out. I feel so numb. I don't know if anyone will understand. ",2025-03-20 03:18:36,mentalhealth

1jffnjn,"Concerned for my brother and mom, what to do? How can I talk to them about it?","For a few years now, my mom and brother have had some of the worst fights/arguments every once in a while, and I think tonight pushed me over the edge.
It’s not like they fight every day, after all, my parents are separated, and we switch between here and my dad’s house every week. However, I can’t stand hearing them blame each other for problems.

My brother has been at a super low point mentally for years it seems, especially since he started smoking weed a few years ago. He’s definitely getting better lately, and I trust him when he swears that he’s been trying to get clean and improve himself, but I think he also has some behavioural issues or even a possible personality disorder of some sort, since he gets irritated much easier than other people, and I worry when he doesn’t clean up after himself, he goes on hour-long walks and constantly smells like he hasn’t been washing himself. In the past, he’s also lashed out at my other two brothers for just suggesting that he’s been smoking, stealing or whatever. I know for a fact he has been stealing our stuff for a while, my transit card has gone missing many times, one time I even just had to get a new one, and app records show that it had been used nowhere near where I use it. He’s also stolen money, and other various things.

My mom, on the other hand, has struggled with anxiety and (in my opinion) other undiagnosed issues that affect her daily. She says that she’s always just been super worried about her kids, no doubt because my whole family (me, my parents, and three older brothers) are in some way neurodivergent and/or have some mental illness. There’s not a doubt in my mind that my mom is truly worried about her children, but sometimes I think she takes it too far. She’s the type of parent who really does care, but then sometimes says “Oh, so I’M the bad guy??” or whatever. She’s always so incredibly stressed out, and whenever me or my brothers offer to help her with a chore that she has literally been complaining about none of us doing, or we tell her that all she needs is to ask for help, she just rants or says like “No, I’m fine! It’s okay you don’t need to help me”

There are so many better ways for my mom to talk to my brother about her concern for him and his health, but when my brother says that our dad has a much better way of handling his habits and talking to him, she gets so offended, especially if in the middle of an argument. But at the same time, my brother seems to not care when he tells my mom to f off, shut up, or that she’s crazy for suggesting that he’s doing worse than he is or something. My mom sure is great at escalating a situation, but my brother can be too if I’m being honest.

I love both of them to bits, and I know they love each other— they literally both said “Good night, I love you” after arguing tonight— but sometimes they make it really hard to love them.

Does anyone know what I can do in this situation? If more clarification or detail is needed, or if this isn’t an appropriate post for this sub, let me know, I’ve never posted her before.

1jffm9e,"HOT TAKE:  Reddit is not therapy… honestly, it’s the opposite sometimes.","I don’t know who needs to hear this, but be careful coming here when you’re really struggling. Reddit can feel like the only place to vent because it’s anonymous, but let’s be real—people here are *cruel*. Cold. Dismissive.  
It’s easy to forget there are actual human beings behind the screen, but it feels even easier for people to forget *you’re* a real human when you post.

You open up about your worst thoughts, just hoping for someone to say, “Hey, I’ve been there too”... and instead you get hit with:

* “Seek help.”
* “Why would you even post this?”
* “You sound like a burden.”
* Or worse—downvotes into oblivion, like your feelings don’t matter at all.

And that messes you up more. Makes you wonder if you *are* too much. If maybe the world really is as cold as it feels.

But you’re not. You’re just trying to survive. Trying to feel seen somewhere, *anywhere*.

Reddit isn’t therapy. Half the people here are fighting their own battles, some too numb to care, some projecting their pain right back at you. And it hurts, because you deserve *so much more* than this.  
You deserve someone who looks you in the eye, listens, and says, *“I’m glad you’re still here.”*  
Not another stranger trying to win internet points off your pain.

Please don’t let this place convince you that you’re unlovable.  
You’re not. You’re a human being who deserves real love, real care, real connection. Reddit will never be enough for that.

1jffk58,Is my decision the best I can do? 26M,"So in context, hello I am medical student outside the U.S. and right now I am in my last year which in my country is sending you wherever in the country to work for 6months or a year. You do not choose which place you want to go, you can only appeal by stating your personal cases. 

Now I appealed since I have financial issues at home, my dad does not work and does not want to either, my mom is a stay at home mom and my dad just got comfortable receiving a money from a land he sold which we get money sporadically. He uses about 80% of it in building a business which has been a work in progress for about 20 years and doesnt budget for it. He has been violent with my mom and me, emotionally abusive and just a bad person all around.

Now for the case at hand, I got sent to a far away place for my medical practice, which increases my expenses add on to it that I have about $1500 in debt(I am not asking for money), my mental health has been decreasing because of my debt, I feel stuck and because of the nature of what I am studying I can't get a job while I study, I know it is just one more year, but I don't have financial stability or mental to be treating patients, and my option was to take a break from it, work , pay off my debts and have a bit saved to return to study.

Now I feel bad about taking a break since when I was younger I wasted 2 years studying something else, and makes me feel like I failed and I am the worst human being to make this decision. I just feel its the only way and it makes me sad and angry at myself.

Recently a friend of a friend started liking me and we've become friends since and I early on established that our relationship was going to be purely platonic because I didn't reciprocate his feelings but I feel extremely bad for not reciprocating his feelings and like a waste of time.

Sometimes i try to imagine them doing something silly in order to sort of ridiculous-ify them but its almost like my brain punishes me for it, or projects some agency onto them and in response to me trying to make light of it makes them twice as scary by imagining them rushing up close to my face and/or other things to increase the intensity

1jfeo2g,Is it because of my bpd and npd?,"My name is Lamb and I’m 19 years old, I recently got diagnosed with bpd, npd and body dysmorphia, when I got the results I didn’t care much, because I wasn’t surprised. All my life ever since I was a toddler I’ve been love bombed but then ghosted out of the blue and I could never understand WHY, LIKE WHY!? I was sweet, loving and respectful and was a good person but people just loved to put me down and ghost me when they got me attached to them. I used to sulk and let those “friends” treat me that way because I was desperate for acceptance love and friendship but it came to a point.

Because of all the heartbreak and betrayal I’ve become very bitter and just a fucked up individual, I started to become a prick who would love bomb people who wanted to be my friends, when they got attached to me I would be emotionally abusive and push them to their limits to see how far they’ll go to stay with me to argue over little things to make them angry or go off on me so they would leave me, the reason why I wanted to make them leave me was because I wanted to say “Ha I knew it, your just like all the others” to gaslight them, if they still wanted to stay in my life I would cut off all relationships or ghost them because I just can’t believe that someone would actually want to care for me or be my friend.

I’ve only had one boyfriend and it was an online one we met in a gore group chat which was on telegram (764 / 6996), I was 15 and he was 40 and he instantly fell for me, on the first day of talking he gave me his social security number, his address and all his banking information, he was my first boyfriend so I really loved him, he was extremely obsessive and attached (we were on call 24/7, even when I was sleeping, we had planned how I would run away so I could live with him, start a family and be together forever) because of my past which I just explained to you I would try to break up with him almost every other day because I was scared of him leaving me, I didn’t ask him to and would’ve never asked him to but he self harmed to make me stay and would even hurt his cat to guilt trip me into staying, he even cut my name into his skin (I cut his name into my chest too after him to show my love and devotion) all this at first scared me but then it made me happy because it made me feel wanted. He was the one for me because he genuinely loved me and wanted to be with me, but it all came crashing down because he got arrested for having CP, I quickly left him after that and ghosted him completely and left all the gore group chats I was in. He was the only man that loved me and I won’t ever believe that anyone could love me like him. It feels surreal to be me because all I want is to be loved and love back but i keep switching from loving and toxic and I don’t get why.

As of now I’ve been trying to become a better person, I still have issues with my image but I no longer ghost, but that’s only because I don’t give people a chance anymore. Whenever someone approaches me in person to be my friend I tell them that I’m not able to because I need to concentrate on my study’s and make money because of my job. As for people who are romantically interested with me whenever they try to get my number or ask me on dates I tell them I’m married, I literally wear a wedding ring on my finger.

1jfelyn,I want to write a letter to a former good friend,"My best friend in elementary school and junior high began to drift away from me in high school. I became really depressed and was hospitalized my senior year. He helped, as he did several times that year. In college, we kept in touch, I attended his wedding, although he chose another friend as his best man. We were friends until my fourth hospitalization. I do not remember much from my time in the psych ward. I was prescribed haldol and half a dozen medicines; none I which I remember. 

I do remember having access to a telephone, and I had phone numbers in a little book, I think I had his. It’s very vague, but I think I acted out on the phone with him. Unfortunately, I think I became too toxic for our relationship to continue. 

I saw him several years ago. We exchanged words, I should be grateful that we could do that. There are people I have invited into my life that are not on speaking terms with me.

I wonder if enough time has passed. I wonder if I have grown humble enough to maybe have an in person talk, eventually. I want to write him a letter. He has a family now, a wife, kids. I have neither. He married his high school sweetheart. She and I were friends, also. 

I want to write him a letter. I think it should express remorse. Maybe I can apologize. I have been on medicine for 8 years straight. I see my therapist every week. I have my doubts, but is writing a letter worth a shot?

I had a friend die recently who was also in his 20s, and he was so positive and full of life and was really pursuing his passions. I’ve always admired people like him— and like my grandpa, who never ever lets things get to him too much and is just incredibly sweet and caring and positive. 

I am feeling so sad and let down by the fact that I haven’t seemed to get to a place where I can live this way and have this mindset, when I believe it’s the best way to live.

Now I know its be they didnt wanna force me onto things I didnt like but I wish theyd offer the options to me. From 6-8th grade was when i started being more aware of myself and the people around me.
Insecurity about my appearance popped up and I mean since then its gotten much better with the self esteem but what im tryna say is i dont feel like i have anything I can be proud of except the fact that from exactly a year ago til now ive truly changed drastically as a person. That event was a relationship and after the breakup i decided to be a better person, i took my mask off for the first time outside in July and grew comfortable like that, strangers smiled at me and it was just great know? Life was good for a few months the little things amazed me i was really grateful for the things I have to the point i would cry (sounds ridiculous ik).

1jfdrsr,What do you think about this?,"Hello, I'm pretty new to this, I'm a 16M and I don't sharing my feelings much, with my family, with my friends, and I tried a therapist once but it didn't work out. I say this to say that I'm ""depressed"", and i say that with quotation marks because I don't actually know if I am / should be. For example, a girl who is raised in a loving stable home, and has never experienced a single injury in life has just cut his arm accidently, he panics and has an emotional meltdown. For the boy who has never experienced pain in his life, is his reaction warranted? Is he allowed to feel that way? Depression is defined in many different ways, by many different people, there are people who are in very shitty situations, and there are those who are living their life to the fullest. I spiral often, I think about what the point of my life is if every day has no means to an end, nothing in my sense is fulfilled, I don't achieve much of anything, and therefore it drains me until I'm numb. Am I allowed to feel this way? I have so many friends who have worse situations compared to me, and they keep it together. They don't stress out as much as I do, and that must mean my reactions are false and unwarranted, right? I don't know anymore, I'm ashamed of my emotions and I need help, but I don't know what I'm looking for.  ",2025-03-20 01:38:01,mentalhealth
1jfdr6f,"My friend just called me and said that they were doing sh, I need advice on what to do and what to say.","    Okay, so basically, what happened was that I was playing on my phone, rotting my brain with stimulation. (as usual) Suddenly, my friend called me and told me that they have a girlfriend. Obviously, I was super happy for them, but then he just blurted out that he is going to carve out their initials into his skin. 
    
I was very distraught and worried about him, and when I said that, he just mostly moved on from the subject, and we started talking about video games. 
    
Within the last 5 minutes of the call, he said that all his friends were uncomfortable and weird about him cutting himself and that he didn'tsee a problem with it. I told him that as his best friend, it did sound concerning and weird from an outside perspective. I told him that he should talk to his therapist or his mom or dad about this and that I was genuinely worried for him. After I said that, he kinda just shrugged and said, ""I'm gonna go now , bye!"" and ended the call.

I am just so conflicted on what to do.

Do I keep this a secret?

Do I tell my mom (who is best friends with his mom) 

Do I tell his mom?

Do I just try to convince him to stop?

    I really have no idea what to do. I love him so much. He is my #1 best friend, and all I want is for him to be safe and happy. He's been admitted to the mental hospital before, and it would physically break me if I found out he had to go again. Not because I don't want him to go, but the fact that he HAD to go in the first place.",2025-03-20 01:37:10,mentalhealth

1jfd1o8,I have been feeling mildly depressed for the past 4-5 years. I feel like I finally found the cure.,"I (19M) feel like I have been stuck in a chronic depression of moderate intensity since September of 2020. While I was always 100% functional, I was always bored and my thoughts were negative.  However, I am on vacations at my grandparent's house and realized something. 

I just need to stop being online, and the depression I have been stuck in for nearly 5 years will go away. Since the beggining of the pandemic, I took the habit of being on YouTube and reddit a lot more than I was before. This leaves me bored and seeking negative content, and yet addicted due to the intensity of what can be found online. 

The thing that made it click is that due to being at my grandparent's house, I spend a lot more time walking outside and socializing compared to my usual schedule, which is 100% video games and social media. The negative thoughts are almost gone. Boredom is temporary, and it allows me to relax. Even then, it is mostly linked to the little time I spend on my laptop. 

I remember that for the new year of 2024, I was in vacation and walking all the time, barely touching any screen. I remember this as being one of the few times I felt happy. I also realize that I was not on YouTube and reddit nearly as much before taking habits due to online classes during the pandemic.

1jflqw9,When the Mind is Calm but the Body Panics.,"Months ago, I went through one of the toughest experiences of my life. I was traveling, feeling completely fine until the moment I laid down in bed at the hotel. Out of nowhere, my body started shaking, and nausea hit me like a wave. I looked in the mirror and I looked fine, but I couldn’t stop the tremors or the urge to throw up. Nothing helped. I washed my face, tried to breathe, tried to distract myself, but my body just wouldn’t calm down.

The weird thing is, I’ve had plenty of panic attacks before. I know them well. But that day, my mind was completely fine. No racing thoughts, no overwhelming fear, nothing. And yet, my body was reacting like it was in full panic mode. I couldn’t understand why.

At some point, I decided to leave the hotel for a bit. I went out, bought some herbal remedies and a few light snacks, and suddenly I was fine. No shaking, no nausea, nothing. It was like my body had reset itself. But the moment I got back in bed, the symptoms hit me again.

I eventually gave up, just lay there staring at the window, feeling helpless until I finally managed to sleep for two hours. But when I woke up, the symptoms were still there. That’s when I decided to pack my things and take a six-hour journey back.

I don’t know if it was anxiety, exhaustion, or something else entirely. But what I do know is this. No matter how brutal that experience was, I have no problem going through it again. A second time, a third, a thousand times. Because at the end of the day, I’m not afraid, because there’s nothing to be afraid of.

From a young age I've always been scared of dogs, the barking, the unpredictability etc. It doesn't matter what size dog it is, I'm scared of them. I was bit when I was younger and ever since then it has been something I get worried over.

Then for insects, I have always been scared of them. Flies for the diseases they carry. Wasps and bees because they sting. No matter where I am if they are nearby I panic. And it's starting to impact me badly. I am constantly looking around trying- if I see any to get away. People in my life have laughed at me and called me a toddler for the intense panic I feel. 

Finally, people. I'm scared of people. I have no idea what some people are thinking, they might hurt me. I know this may sound stupid but to me it is stressing me out so much. 

Death, I'm scared of it. I don't know what happens to us. I'm scared that darkness is all that awaits me and it makes me feel so uneasy.

Since then I’ve had severe anxiety every day, I’ve had a couple of moments of relief when I’ve seen friends or got into the office, or even Tuesday I was okay. 

But the majority of the time I’m battling DPDR, nausea, feeling like I’ll faint, thinking I’ll go blind, my mind feels like it’s buzzing, near constant intrusive thoughts. I just feel like I can’t cope.

I was in sertraline 100mg for 5 years, then went straight over to Venlafaxine 75mg. This felt too strong for me and it made my brain feel like I was on cocaine and I just felt horrible. I came off of it for 1 month then went back on to 37.5mg last Thursday. I didn’t take it last night as yesterday was so bad (I was so sure I could hear screaming in my head, then I felt like every sound was just louder), today I feel on edge like my brain is on the cusp of making me have a huge panic attack or just screaming, going psychotic or schizo and all the other fun things we experience as chronic anx peeps.

INSTANT panic attack. Was SO close to calling 911.

Anyway, ever since then I've been feeling I guess like... near constant minor-ish anxiety?

Anythingggg that makes my heart speed up a bit - even the slightest bit of exercise or whatever, is almost tricking me into thinking I'm having a panic attack again.  
I'm mostly able to reign it back under control with breathing exercises and distracting myself but it's notttt fun. I had like 4? ekg's a little over half a year ago and everything was fine so I'm not overly worried about my heart or anything... but again, it's not fun.  
I don't like my heart racing just from running up stairs and I know that's not normal for me because prior to my latest huge panic attack, I was completely fine with walking up the stairs so like... why has my heart decided it wants to panic now ugh  lol  
I had this happen about half a year ago as well, after I had back to back panic attacks. Like 4-5 within a month, for awhile any sort of exercise or anything more than slow movement made me feel like I was going to have another panic attack and it lasted over a month. ugh. Hopefully it doesn't last over a month this time...  
I'm tense, it sometimes feels like I'm almost suffocating? idk it's hard to explain - i can breathe fine but my neck/chest just feel... tight? idk. Sometimes my brain suddenly feels like... empty for a second. It's weird.

\-I got into the bathtub while it was still filling up and I could feel the tub kinda vibrating... Like that's so normal? It makes sense? The tap was turned on full blast, of course the tub is going to sorta vibrate?? but nope, heart? racing.

\-I weighed myself and lost like 4lbs....  Yeahhh, idk 4lbs isn't even... a lot? and I weighed myself previously around a month before so it wasn't like I lost it in a few days... Still made me almost have a panic attack.

1jfk2sb,Panic attacks for a year now,"Hello Redditors,

About one year ago I had my first panic attack while I was in my car. I rushed home and told my parents to drive me to ER. From there it started...

For a year now I have been to ER 5 times, I had all the check ups (heart multiple times, lungs, stomach, brain, allergies) but I came to conclusion that is just panic attacks and I will not die. I went to psychologist but he did not help me much. I went to psychiatrist and he told me that I should use medication and I didnt because I am afraid of the aftermath and any addictions that may come up.

So I tried to do things alone..

I tried to control my breathing (5 sec in and 5 sec out, this was proposed by the psychiatrist), I tried to go out for walks, I quit smoking, I reduced alcohol ( I only drink now 1-2 times per month) and it worked....kinda...

For 1-2 months I was ok and 2 weeks before, I started going to the gym. I went 3 times and suddenly... a panic attack. From this day and for 1 week now I feel terrible, my stomach is in pain again, when I ride the subway I think I will pass out and when I go home I just want to sleep and wake up tired..

My work is not so anxious, I live with my GF now and everything run smooth, I do not do drugs and I enjoy life as much as I can. I try to be a better person overall. But I struggle with this thing.. real struggle.

I need some advice on this...

1jfjumu,Chest pain that comes and goes throughout the year,"Hello everyone,for context I am (19F) I am writing this just sort of as a rant and to see if anyone can relate so I don't feel so alone. 

For the past year I have had chest pain that comes and goes. These 'flare ups' (I guess you could call them) last for weeks if not months. It's a dull pressure like feeling and I get it in my back as well. 

I am not worried about my heart I have had countless ECG's, tests, and scans and everything has come back fine. I do struggle with anxiety and have done for a while I have also experienced panic attacks, but when these flare ups come I never feel consciously anxious about anything which is so frustrating because I have had times in my life where I have been a lot more stressed and anxious about things. 

This then starts to make me think how can this possibly be anxiety. I know that being subconsciously stressed is a thing but I'm tired, whenever I get one of these flare ups my life gets put on hold from the pain and I get really down. It feels like everytime I rebuild myself back up and start having a life again it happens again! 
Anyway can anyone relate to this? ",2025-03-20 08:01:09,anxiety

1jfjee3,I feel like I’m going crazy,"I've been struggling with health anxiety for 8 years now. 
I was always nervous/anxious growing up but the bad anxiety started with 2 hospitalizations from an extensive blood clot 8 years ago.
On January 31 of this year I was diagnosed with a second blood clot and I've been spiraling since then and my anxiety is getting worse everyday. I am on fluoxetine but I'm struggling really bad right now. I did seek help and will be seeing a psychiatrist in April. 
Anyways, about 4 weeks ago I developed eye twitching and it hasn't gone away. Everyone keeps telling me it's my stress and anxiety but I have fixated on it so much and I've convinced myself I have a brain tumor. I've suffered from migraines since I was a teenager so having migraines and eye twitching doesn't help my anxiety at all. 
I've gotten to the point where I cannot sleep. I am so anxious and my mind won't shut off. My body feels anxious and I cannot fall asleep. Right as I'm falling asleep, my body starts twitching. It kinda feels like I'm falling and I wake up. Has anyone experienced that before? 

I cannot take it anymore. I feel like I'm gonna go crazy. I need sleep but I cannot sleep. 
I've told my drs that fluoxetine is not working for me but they keep brushing me off. I'm so sad and scared. ",2025-03-20 07:25:08,anxiety

The dentist confirmed the infections (she even pressed out pus from my wisdom tooth). I left the dental office with medicated mouth wash. I also already had a Z pack and took one dose before the dentist. She told me it won’t cure the tooth infection but would clear up the tonsil infection and could buy time until my wisdom tooth removal. 

Basically I have everything I need? But still anxious. I took the first antibiotic dose and I swear I feel the tooth pain even more/pressure in my jaw. The tonsil infection is making the anxiety worse because doesn’t that mean it’s spreading 😭😭😭😭

1jfgb5l,Terrified of Lupus Nephritis or Scleroderma After Months of Health Anxiety – Need Advice,"I’ve been struggling with extreme health anxiety ever since I had a viral illness 10 months ago. Since then, I’ve been terrified of autoimmune diseases and have been doing monthly check-ups and lab tests. I've experienced various symptoms over this time, which have only worsened my anxiety.

Ten months ago, I occasionally had left flank pain, but my urine tests, creatinine levels, and kidney ultrasound were all normal. Autoimmune tests also came back negative. Later, I developed frequent urination, but multiple urine cultures showed no infection. A urologist diagnosed me with a neurogenic bladder.

Then, a few months ago, my urine test started showing trace blood, and two days ago, it showed trace protein for the first time. I repeated the test today, and trace protein was still present, along with moderate blood. This has completely thrown me into panic mode—I’m terrified that I have lupus nephritis or scleroderma affecting my kidneys.

Five months ago, my liver enzymes were fluctuating, and despite normal imaging, I insisted on a liver biopsy, which came back normal except for mild fatty liver. That issue resolved, but now this protein in my urine is making me panic again.

Over these past 10 months, my inflammation markers and autoimmune tests have always been negative, except for one borderline ANA result right after my viral illness—which later turned negative.

I can’t stop overthinking, and I’m terrified of kidney disease. Does anyone have experience with this? Could this still be lupus or scleroderma? What should I do?

1jffc2k,Appointment tomorrow to talk about potential medication options,"So. I’ll sum this up the best I can. I’ve had severe anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I’ve been on various antidepressants with horrible side effects, but I finally found one (Wellbutrin) that really helps my depression. I’ve been on it for about 3 years. 

My anxiety is something that’s always there, at an annoying yet manageable level. Asides from the regular times of heightened anxiety, I’ll go through weeks where my anxiety is unbearable and I’m constantly either in an anxiety attack or dealing with the hangover from one. I’ll have about 5-8 major anxiety attacks per day. I’m in the middle of one of these and feeling like I can’t take it anymore.

I’m hoping to get some medication that I can take as needed that can help with these difficult weeks. My concern is that the doctor will suggest I get off Wellbutrin since one of the side effects is heightened anxiety. However, I truly don’t feel as if the Wellbutrin has had any impact on my anxiety. I’m also concerned about possible drug interactions between benzos (I’m open to other types of meds, but this is all I know of that would help) and Wellbutrin. 

I guess I’m wondering if anyone would be willing to share their experiences with antidepressants/anti-anxiety medications. What are some other types of meds that I could take when experiencing a big-anxiety week that aren’t benzos?",2025-03-20 02:59:06,anxiety

1jfeq3u,Am I Permanently Broken? What Happened to Me?,"I’m 22 now, and I feel like I’ve lost something in myself over the past four years. Before the age of 18, I wasn’t like this at all—everything I’m about to describe just wasn’t me back then. But during these years, I’ve slowly changed, and I don’t know why.

Socializing used to be easy, but now it feels like a chore. I don’t enjoy it anymore because I overthink everything. Before a conversation, I think about what I should say. During it, I monitor myself, wondering if I sound weird or if I’m saying the right things. After it, I replay everything in my head, analyzing whether it went well. I never used to do this.

Now, I sometimes find myself zoning out completely, just staring at nothing, my mind blank. When people talk to me, I don’t always have responses. I just say ""yes,"" ""no,"" ""really,"" ""oof"", short and empty answers, even when I want to say more. I wasn’t like this before. I used to be engaged in conversations, I could flow naturally, joke, and actually enjoy talking to people.

My memory feels off too. I struggle to recall words when speaking, and I can’t remember conversations well—it’s like they disappear from my mind right after they happen. Even when I read or learn something new, it doesn’t stick like it used to. My thoughts feel fast but disorganized, like they’re just noise in my head, not full ideas.

I also worry about how I come across all the time—if I’m saying the right thing, if I sound smart, if I seem normal. I even think about eye contact too much, like “am I holding it too long?” or “should I look away now?” It’s exhausting, and it makes me feel even more disconnected.

My confidence dropped so much over these four years, probably by 70%. I doubt myself constantly, and I don’t speak with confidence anymore. I feel less competent than other people—on a social level, on a critical thinking level, on every level.

On top of all this, there was a sad event in my life—my mother went through a really bad depression. It was awful to see, and maybe that affected me more than I realized. Thankfully, she’s much better now, but I still feel the same—tired, worried, anxious, and stuck in my own head.

I used to watch a lot of porn in the past, and I wonder if that’s part of the problem. I went 100 days without it, but I don’t feel completely back to normal. Could that be messing with my focus and emotions too?

I want to fix this, but I don’t know how. Am I permanently broken? Can I get back to how I used to be? Has anyone else gone through something like this?",2025-03-20 02:26:39,anxiety
1jfepwd,How long does it take for a sertraline/zoloft dosage increase to take effect?,"I’ve been on Zoloft for about three years now for moderate generalized anxiety disorder. I have emetophobia and some agoraphobia, both trigger panic attacks pretty easily. Before I was on medication I was having one or two panic attacks a day. After starting Zoloft and buspirone, my panic attacks completely stopped. I haven’t had any since I started taking them (aside from when I smoke weed). 

About three weeks ago I suffered a mild concussion, and ever since then I’m back to how I was pre-medication. On the way to urgent care the day of, I got nauseous from the car ride and had a panic attack in the parking lot. I had a bit of off and on anxiety for the rest of that day and into the next. On my third day post concussion, I had a severe panic attack that lasted five hours. 

Since the concussion I’ve been having very random panic attacks, out of nowhere I will just get hit with a wave of panic and have a difficult time calming down. I also still get panic attacks from triggering situations. 

Because my symptoms were completely gone for years, a couple months ago I stepped down from 37.5 mg sertraline to 25 mg. Since my symptoms are unfortunately reappearing, I’m moving back up to 37.5 mg. 

I’m making this post because I have a concert coming up in two weeks, and I know it’ll probably be panic inducing for me, so I want to know if by that point I’ll be doing any better. I know it’s different for everyone, I just want to hear what experiences you guys have had with it to see what my trajectory might be.

1jfdu1f,30-Day Experiment: Running on “Bad” Sleep,"Hey everyone,

I tend to overshare my struggles with family, so this time, I’m putting my thoughts here as a way to hold myself accountable—and maybe even help others in a similar situation.

3 years ago, my nervous system broke down. It felt like a bomb went off in my body, a few weeks after I had covid (and after 20 years of building unmanageable levels of stress+anxiety!). I was hit with crippling anxiety and physical symptoms that left me bed-bound for about a year. The last 18 months, however, have been a steady recovery. I can now run, hike mountains, and cycle long distances. I take a low dose of Lexapro, but most of my progress comes down to time, effort, and challenging ingrained fears.

The one lingering issue? Sleep.

I usually get 6.5–7.5 hours, which is good by most peoples standards, but I wake up between 4:30–5:30 AM. Instead of getting up, I lie there for two hours, spiraling into frustration, anxiety, and negative emotions. If I sleep less than 7 hours, I convince myself I’m broken—dizzy, in pain, hearing tinnitus, fearing long-term health consequences. If I get more than 7 hours, I feel OK and positive about the day.

I've tried a lot of things -- going to bed later to shift my body clock, using white noise, earplugs, eye masks etc. But I cannot seem to sleep much past 6am on the best of days. It's been like this for years now.

I know my morning pattern is unhealthy. So, for the next 30 days, I’m running first thing in the morning—no matter how I slept.

**The Experiment**

* Every morning, I’ll wake up, put on pre-prepared running clothes, and head outside—without overthinking it.
* I’ll track my wake-up time, my mental state before and after, and see what happens.
* The goal: to challenge the belief that “bad” sleep ruins my day.

What if I feel better after the run? What if I don’t collapse from exhaustion? What if, after 30 days, my sleep improves because I stop fearing it?

I’ll update this post with my results. Let’s see what happens.

Note: This isn’t a post about the effects of covid—that’s not the focus here. Let’s keep the discussion on topic, please!

**Results**

|Day|Waking time|Thoughts before run|Thoughts after run|

1jfdt6k,Struggling,"I'm a 17 year old guy. I already have a plan to get out of this neglectful filthy environment. In currently studying my drivings test and planning on getting a car and my driver's license with my parents by the time I turn 18, and when I'm 18, I'm immediately applying to job corps to catch up on the years of school I'm behind on, but I'm mainly going to be able to get out of this environment asap. But I'm still very worried because the ONE disease I'm having anxiety about is of course the most rare incurable disease out there, Prions. Please don't click off yet. I'm not an idiot, I realize how rare this disease is. But my environment that consists of being a very unsanitary farm with dog and cat feces and urine present in and outside the house constantly, unvaccinated animals, AND irresponsible parents that don't feed COWS we have correctly, which is literally where you most commonly get prions from an environment, my fears are atleast valid. My arm has been twitching recently sometimes, and body twitching is a symptom so obviously I'm even more worried. And my memory is lowkey bad. The house is so fucking filthy. And since we don't have fixed cats and dogs, there is literally dog period blood just on the floor as I'm walking around the house. And since the many big dogs we have in the house are untrained, we let them use the bathroom on 4 puppy pads that are washed in the washer we all use for laundry. I'm so uncomfortable I don't touch anything outside of my own room without washing my hands. I only eat the food I prepare so I make sure everything that touches it is clean, and I genuinely don't feel hopeful or happy for the future. I'm convinced I'm going to die before I get to leave this place. I'm pretty convinced there's a chance I have prions, and I'm just hoping if I do the incubation period is long enough so after turn 18 I can go get tested and see if I can test if I have prions so I can begin treatment before prions start to damage me, but with how long I've been living in this place, I feel like I'm going to start dying soon. I get it's rare. 1/6000 people get it. But living in an environment like this, irresponsible parents, plus with cows getting into coops/and maybe being fed the wrong food that's not specifically for cows, I don't see how I won't be the 1/6000. I'm probably not going to stop worrying about prions until I get tested, but until then, I hope anyone here can give me some good news that's something other than ""it's rare."" Yes, it's rare, for normal households. Not to mention, lots of animals have died here before due to unfixed cats having kittens that have died, and a few months back, the kitten was eaten in half in the garage by the other cats or kittens for whatever reason. I guess because it was dying. And I buried it. For all I know now the cats got prions from eating their own kind, and there are prions on the garage floor. God I hate my life.

1jfdskk,Hydroxyzine medication and airplanes,"Good Morning everyone. I have an irrational fear of flying. Nothing calms me down. No podcasts, movies, breathing techniques, closing my eyes nothing.

1jfdc3y,What I’ve learned so far about anxiety might help you too.,"I want to write this with the thought that maybe it will help many of those who are dealing with anxiety

Currently I am still in recovery but if I look at it objectively I am functioning almost as if I don't have anxiety

How did it all start? 2018 (it was a stressful time for me studies and a failed relationship) sounds childish exactly how I thought at the time, the problem is that I didn't understand that even things that seem everyday or ""banal"" affect us subconsciously, I was on the street and I felt a strong palpitation I couldn't resist the sensation and I ended up at the hospital where they did blood tests + ekg, everything perfectly normal, from there I developed an ocd + health anxiety related to my heart health (checked constant pulse) I must add that I did not understand and did not have the current knowledge of how the psyche works so I was looking for a palpable problem and that problem from my point of view had to be a medical one, I went through other tests that came out perfect + two more panic attacks at home, I realized after the 3rd one that everything starts from my brain not from a palpable problem necessarily, since then I started to discover and learn what is going on.

I have been through all the anxieties honestly but the most affected me health anxiety (fear of imminent death) 

What I have learned (recently even) is that you have to learn to accept and ik you hear it everywhere and maybe it sounds clichéd and something you hear all the time … 
To accept means that the moment you feel or you are in the feeling of anxiety is to stop to counteract the feeling, to stop to find a specific reason for it often we tend to give it a high purpose and if we do that we put it on a pedestal and we both try to bring it down although we still put it there, it is a vicious circle, when you are face to face with anxiety try not to do anything ik it is really extremely difficult because the fear of the unknown intervenes (what happens if I don't intervene? What if it takes over? If X or Y is going to happen) well you'll soon find out that you are in control in the end and you only find that out after you accept and let it be and exist with you

What happens further is that initially you feel afraid that you risk losing control but with time you will notice that the feeling is harmless and has no control over you unless you give it over and over again importance and you keep putting it on the pedestal from which you try to dethrone it, what you don't know is that this will not be the only time because your brain has learned a toxic pattern of defending itself when it shouldn't so this will repeat itself many times, and you every time you will teach your brain NOT to react and not to activate the survival instinct when you do not need it, YOU will teach him on this occasion that ""It's okay to feel bad in an area with many people, that it's okay if you faint in public, that it's ok if you get sick on the street”, that any situation he throws at you won't make you run away because every situation is fleeting as the feeling itself you'll find out is not and won't stay with you for more than a few hours/minutes

This is truly the next big thing—the fact that the sensation comes and goes, once you train your brain to stop being restless and to stop reacting irrationally in situations where you don’t want to run away and hide in a comfortable and safe place.

The next part is when you try to anticipate (Will I be anxious today? Maybe tomorrow? Maybe in situation X or Y? I’m breathing a bit heavily now—could my heart stop right this moment?). Well, find out that you don’t have absolute control, but that’s actually a good thing because you’re repeating the training from earlier. Over time, your brain learns when you’re actually triggering its survival instincts and when you’re not. In the future, it will reduce the supposed situations it wants to put you in. But at the same time, you’ll notice that it will also test you—it’s just like a faulty switch, turning on when you least expect it. So don’t think you’ve completely escaped it, and the main idea is that you don’t actually want to get rid of anxiety.

Anxiety is, after all, a normal sensation that we need, but we don’t need it all the time. That’s another important thing. Anxiety is actually very beneficial for the human body, but it should only come into play when we truly need it.

Finally, after boring you with information you probably hear everywhere, I just want to say that therapy has helped me a lot in parallel. I wholeheartedly recommend it. I’m pretty sure that we all manage anxiety differently, but personally, all these years, I’ve made it a priority to avoid any treatment involving benzos and to try to regulate myself with minimal help (therapy, psychologists, self-learning). And I believe it’s possible if you start with this mindset.

Don’t rush into the world of benzos right away—first, try to exhaust all non-medical options. And if you do end up needing them, try to alternate and not use anything as a crutch, because that way, you’re not teaching your brain anything. 
Oh and try not to turn tricks you find online into routines. good example: I don’t know if you’ve heard of the ice cube trick, but think about it—this means that in situations where you feel anxious, you’d need ice with you. Where are you going to find ice cubes on a plane or on the street? It’s just a toxic band-aid, fooling yourself. And that’s just one popular example I’ve tried—there are many others like it that only deceive you instead of reshaping how you react to triggers.

Finally, as someone with anxiety level 999 master, I also accept questions, and I’ll answer them to the best of my knowledge, of course.",2025-03-20 01:16:46,anxiety

1jfd5ro,I cannot sleep or relax due to extreme death and health anxiety and feel very mentally unsafe.,"I couldn't find my other post so I am making a new one, sorry if there's two different posts.

On two recent occasions I have been to the ER for panic attacks. First time, I woke up abruptly from sleep, had a rapid heart rate, bloating, felt like I was going to poop (and die from it), and wasn't sure if I was going to die or have a heart attack. I had an elevated d-dimer which prompted a chest CT scan but that revealed nothing. EKG came back with tachycardia and possible left atrial enlargement (doctor did not seem concerned). TSH was 50 (I was previously on levothyroxine but stopped, I started taking it again after the ER visit). I was discharged with anxiety. The week after this was quite possibly the hardest week of my life, I felt so drained, developed insomnia, depression, bad depersonalization, and of course, more panic attacks.

The sheer visceral experience of panic attacks and feeling like I am dying had forced me to confront my extreme fear of death. I started seeing a therapist and recovered a bit from this event, but panic attacks, especially nocturnal ones, continued.

Fast forward to last week, I had another experience of a wave of extreme panic, sense of doom, rapid heart rate. I identified it as a panic attack, worked through those feelings, but I couldn't quite shake this sense that something was just...off. The next day I woke up and felt weird, but I tried to shrug it off. I couldn't. I went to the ER with a calm head, citing chest pain, dizziness, and sense of doom. EKG came back with possible left atrial enlargement (doctor did not say anything about this) and the nurse said there were muscle tremors on the EKG (whatever that means). They ran blood tests but said everything looked good.

Chopping it up to anxiety, I was medically discharged but spoke with a therapist who referred me to inpatient care for mental health. I shared with her my feelings of feeling like I was going to die, or that something was very wrong. She seemed convinced that it could just be my mental health which felt reassuring. I agreed to inpatient, however, when they placed me in a room with no windows or anything, all white like a psych ward and took away all my belongings and neglected my care (I had to wait several hours for a dinner after not eating all day), I decided I wouldn't feel so safe doing something like that, so I opted to go home.

Since then, I cannot sleep, I cannot shake this sense of doom. I cannot go to bed without the fear of losing consciousness or dying. I haven't slept well in days, and it has made the already existing depression so much worse. I am so sad, I have been crying every day, sobbing uncontrollably at times with the fear that something bad is going to happen to me. I feel like any time I close my eyes, I am dying. I'm afraid I will die of a heart attack, or a brain anuerysym, or have a tumor that is causing my panic attacks.

I am struggling with consistent intrusive thoughts telling me that I am going to die, that this is it for me, that I will die soon, or that death is on the horizon. I have visions of my dead body on the floor. I am doing my best to fight them but it's been very, very hard. I love life and I don't want to die, but this experience has really shook me. I feel like I am going mentally insane and cannot control my anxiety no matter how hard I try. What started as panic attacks now feels like a full blown preoccupation with my own death that is preventing me from feeling well. I feel like I have the flu and physically cannot relax.

I scheduled an urgent appointment with my doctor who prescribed meds for bloating and an anti histamine for sleep and anxiety but I am SO fearful I will have a severe allergic reaction or that it will make me feel worse that I cannot take them.

Could there be something medical causing this extreme discomfort and sense of doom? I feel so heavy and full of grief for so many things right now. The weight of the world is on my chest. It seems like every sensation in my body is causing me to panic. I'm having sharp pains everywhere, back pain, bloating, headaches, jaw pain, sinus pain. I have always struggled health wise -- I have hypothyroidism, migraines, stomach issues, extremely bad periods, and I am always dismissed by doctors as just having anxiety, but I am so fed up with genuinely feeling bad in my body that my soul feels tired.

1jfch4c,I feel like my anxiety is going to kill me and I've been having panic attacks for days straight.,"**Long story:** Mid January I went to the ER because I abruptly woke up out of sleep with a huge sense of impending doom, rapid heart rate, insane stomach bloating and feeling like I had to poop. I wasn't sure if I was going to die or having a heart attack. I had an elevated d-dimer and TSH of 50, chest CT scan revealed nothing, EKG showed tachycardia and possible left atrial enlargement (doctor did not seem concerned about this). 

Discharged with anxiety, the week after this visit I barely ate anything, had insomnia, and got severe depersonalization where I just did not feel real anymore. Fuzzy head, nausea, I just could not function properly. I have always had episodes of panic and anxiety, but nothing this severe. I was prescribed levothyroxine for my hypothyroidism (I stopped taking it and this ER visit prompted me to re take it). 

This experience with panic attacks spurred me to seek a therapist and since then I've been battling with just a heightened sense of anxiety and doom. I started developing a deep depression and nocturnal panic attacks became more frequent. Several nights I would wake up feeling like I was dying, but I tried to focus on my symptoms and calm myself down. However, this has created a situation during the day where I felt sleepy, extreme anxiety, and a fear of going anywhere really on my own because I am afraid of dying.

Last Friday, I had a severe wave of panic again with a rapid heart rate. Again, I thought I was going to die but I tried to work through it. However, it just felt like those feelings of panic became...prolonged. The next day, I tried waking up and going about my day, and I just got this sense that something was off. I went to the ER again, this time with chest pain, dizziness, and sense of doom as my symptoms. I had a mental breakdown there. My EKG again said possible left atrial enlargement again but my heart rate was fine and my labs came back normal (slightly low WBC, high protein). A therapist came and spoke with me and we agreed to inpatient therapy, however, after they took away all my belongings I started to panic even more and decided it wasn't for me. 

Sense that visit, I cannot relax. I feel like death is on my horizon. I will admit that this feels like the first time I am coming to terms with my mortality and it's scaring the hell out of me and making me super sad. I love life, and I want to live it, but I am stuck in a mental rumination cycle where I genuinely feel like something is very off and I am going to die or drop dead at any moment. The visceral experience of panic attacks and feeling like I am dying is making me so depressed. 

My mind says ""this is it, you're going to die"" several times a day, or I have visions of my dead body on the floor. Sometimes I don't feel real or alive and feel very confused when I wake up. I fear that I am going to have a heart attack, or a brain aneurysm, or just die in my sleep. It's like there's a medical emergency looming around the corner and I can't seem to shake the feeling. Any slight sense of pain or pressure anywhere in my body I start freaking out. I have also thought that I could have a tumor that is secreting cortisol and causing waves of intense panic (I am a hypochondriac). 

I actually feel like I am going mentally insane. I don't feel safe anymore, and the past couple days I have had some more ""positive moments"" but the darkness keeps creeping in and it's really scaring me. I am so terrified to sleep because I now have a strong association with sleep and death. I am so beyond exhausted I feel like I had the flu. I scheduled an urgent appointment with my doctor, who prescribed me meds for bloating and an antihistamine for sleeping and anxiety, but I can't bring myself to take them because I'm afraid I will have an allergic reaction or it will make it worse. 

I sought urgent mental health care today and learned some techniques to calm down but I still just have this anxious feeling I can't shake and I keep wanting to go to the ER to feel safe, but I also want to avoid it also because it's triggering me. 

FYI-I recently moved to a rural area where there is a lack of medical care and I have been feeling very isolated, I have to drive 20 minutes to the nearest hospital. More anxiety :) 

Any advice or thoughts would be so appreciated as I am constantly living on edge and genuinely feel like I'm losing my mind and that the stress of all of this will actually kill me. Does this sound like just anxiety? Could there be something medically wrong with me that is making me feel this way? Am I just making myself so sick with the thought of my own mortality?

Quero tentar aliviar isso para conseguir me cuidar, procurar tramamento médico e etc. Alguém conhece casos em que alguém conseguir aliviar os sintomas físicos da ansiedade com medicamento ou algo do tipo?

1jfc1q2,Almost losing someone - Worsening anxiety,"Hi everybody,
At the beginning of February my long-term boyfriend had an accidental opioid overdose, he was very close to death and it was very confronting and eye-opening. I have struggled with anxiety for the entirety of my life, but it has never been relationship centred anxiety until now.
Every single move my boyfriend makes I am worried he's going to leave me, I overanalyse everything he says and does and take it as a personal attack, and I'm constantly reassurance seeking that he isn't going to leave me. It's causing panic attacks I'm that convinced he all of a sudden is going to leave, when he reassures me he isn't and he has no clue why I'm asking. 
Has anybody experienced an anxious attachment style worsening after a traumatic experience? It's all I can pin it down to really :(
Thanks x",2025-03-20 00:13:52,anxiety

I'm afraid it may have chemicals in it. I have a history of generalized anxiety disorder and essential tremors(neurological disorder). I'm on day 19 and I am still having trouble with anxiety all day and night and sleep disturbances. Also, I get super overheated when I lay down for bed. I've been eating healthier and drinking water. Exercising everyday. I sleep, but wake up a lot and it's so hard for me to get to sleep every night. I have hypnic jerks and racing thoughts. ""Brain zaps or shocks"" throughout every day. I recently started on 20 mg celexa for the anxiety for the past 9 days and 50 mg trazodone to help get me past the sleep disturbances. The hypnic jerks are terrifying. It's when you are about to fall asleep and your body just jolts you out of it. My question is, when can I expect things to improve?

1jfbqty,Health Anxiety - Medications?,"Hi all

TL;DR: Health anxiety medications? I have read a lot about propanolol and im wondering if anyone has taken this for specifically health anxiety and if it has assisted?

  
Just my story and my question

Im 28y/o male, and i found out what anxiety was 4 years ago. I smashed my finger with a hammer. Not really a biggie to me, but i was hungover, it was hot and humid outside. I worked construction so cuts/scrapes wasnt a issue so im not sure why this triggered it for me. never had anxiety my whole life until then, or at least noticed any anxiety. It has changed my life and i honestly dont think ive been the same ""happy"" since. Anyways, i ran inside to wash my finger off, as im running cold water over my finger, i get hit with this wave of lightheadedness, tunnel vision, shakes, felt like i had to poop and pee, and a racing heart. felt like i was going to pass out. it absolutely scared me sh1tless. i ran to my room and lied down for a bit. needless to say, those symptoms and sensations happened over and over again off and on for about 6 months before they subsided. Over the last few years, i have never felt specifically all of those all at once the same way, however i still get them along with other new weird sensations. Vibrating type sensations, tingly, unbalanced or rocking type sensations even when im standing still. and trying to stand perfectly still usuall makes it worse and i feel like i cant stand still. So for the last 4/5 months or so my anxiety has kinda snuck back, to the point where i have been hyperfixating on every single body sensation, every single visual change, (like tunnel type vision or just any visual disturbance, not that it happens often). I did a boat load of tests a few years ago, brain MRI, countless blood works, EKGs, heart ultrasounds... Everything is normal. However im still convinced something is wrong with me and im going to pass out or die or have a stroke whenever i start to feel ""off"". or i just sit there and think about whats causing these symptoms, and how to fix it. or i continue to sit there and really feel the symtpoms and they get worse, i cant help but acknowledge them. I havent had a full blown panic attack, but generally im anxious because my mind is always ANALYZING how im feeling, and lately the anxiety keeps ramping up and up but i dont end up having an attack because i can somewhat control it and understand that some of what im feeling is anxiety. Caffeine makes it worse (only sometimes weirdly enough) and my hangovers are a lot more brutal just because of the fact hangover symptoms arent fun. Its the physical sensations and feelings that trigger my anxiety to get worse. Like i personally felt like if i didnt have physical symtpoms and i just felt like my normal self again, i would be fine. but im always analyzing and noticing. like a little tingle, or if i felt off balance real quickly, maybe stood up to fast, or maybe turned my head to fast. or if i notice my heart beating faster at rest, or facial flushing and feeling my face get hot. all of these things i hyper fixate on and i hate it.

  
i have read a lot about propanolol and that it helps remove a lot of anxiety's physical symptoms, and i am wondering if anyone has experienced this or if another medication is helping you? my doctor had said we can go down the medication route and it may help, i just have always been convinced its not anxiety so i didnt want to. but i just want to be happy again.",2025-03-19 23:59:41,anxiety
1jfbn3d,"I am unemployed and autistic and feeling really scared, sad and alone","Hi everyone. I'm 26yo from the UK. I am autistic with ADHD and a history of mental health issues including self harm and suicidal thoughts. I have a diagnosis of GAD as well. Recently, the UK government has announced cuts to social security, especially those for disabled people. This has caused a lot of debate and has brought issues like disability, autism etc right to the surface. I'm seeing a lot more discussion online about these things. I'm having a really tough time because a lot of that discussion is extremely harsh, cruel, callous etc. On UK subreddits I've frequently seen upvoted comments dismissing the idea that autism etc is that big of a deal and that those with it who don't work are just making excuses and lazy. I have personally been unemployed since October 2024 and am applying for jobs as and when I have the capacity to do so. I'm not applying for every job I see because I know there are certain ones that would not be a good fit for me and I wouldn't last a week, such as most customer service or retail jobs. This isn't just a hunch because I have previously tried a job like this, but it completely overwhelmed and overstimulated me and I had to leave after the first day. (Edit: I describe another job below as my first job despite this - I don't count the retail job as my first job because I was only there for a day.)

This is something I've felt a lot of shame over in the past, the idea that I'm not doing enough, that maybe I really am being lazy etc, but I really, really am trying my best. I got my first job in the summer of 2023 which was a huge step for me because I never thought I would be able to get a job, never mind stay there for an extended period of time. I ended up staying there for like a year and a half, up until October 2024. It was a temporary contract and they couldn't renew it due to financial reasons so I was unemployed again. I was devastated to be honest even though I knew it was probably going to happen. Unemployment had caused so much pain and shame to me in the past I was terrified of it happening again.

I was very active in that immediate period after losing the job and had several interviews but none worked out. I got very stressed and burned out by this, especially after one job which I really liked and thought I had a good chance at getting, and I didn't. So I slowed down a bit for maybe a couple of months but then picked back up again, and now I have 2 interviews coming up in the next 2 weeks. I think I have a decent shot at the second one in particular because it's very similar to my old job and in similar organisations. There are two vacancies being filled for it, one part time and one full time, which I'm hoping will also help my chances but I know not to get my hopes up and be realistic that it might not work out. I accept that, I'm just really really scared and sad at all the rhetoric around autistic people particularly at the moment and am feeling misunderstood and hated even though I have always tried my best to be nice to people and feel like I'm not doing anything wrong.

The budget cuts don't even apply to me directly at the moment because I don't claim unemployment benefits in the first place - I have some savings and I am lucky to be able to live with my parents who are very supportive. But I have no idea what my life is going to be like once my parents are not around and the idea of being left on my own in a world that seems to hate people like me is absolutely horrifying. I'm also really upset at the thought of disabled people who are in a less stable position than me losing their benefits and falling into poverty, worsening mental health or even suicide. Thinking about all these really intense societal things is hard when I'm also trying to take care of myself, and they both intertwine.

Yesterday I had to use a Firefox extension to block the news sites I've been going to because they've just been really, really making me anxious and upset. Today, I've filtered out one of the main UK politics subreddit because there are so many hateful and mean comments about disabled people on there. I don't understand why so many people seem to go out of their way to pick on vulnerable people. As well as angry and sad, it makes me feel really profoundly confused because I can't imagine why or how someone would be that cruel. Growing up, I had always believed what adults taught us about being nice to people, listening to them, not making fun of them, treating others as you wish to be treated etc. I think I had assumed all the other kids were also like this but as an adult I'm increasingly disappointed because it feels like no-one else was actually taking those things seriously.

Can someone tell me that I'm doing enough please? I think I need to hear/see it from someone else, just to see someone saying something positive about disabled/neurodivergent people, or about my personal struggles as an unemployed disabled person, because everything else I'm seeing is just so so mean and I can't describe how fucking horrible it makes me feel. I feel like nothing I do will ever be good enough for people in this country.

I have tried so, so hard. I don't know how to communicate how hard I have tried and still do. It crushes me that people are so reluctant to just take my word for it when I say that and would rather dismiss me as some loser making excuses if I told them I'm unemployed and disabled. It's hard not to feel like no-one truly cares about disabled people in this country. I thought I had gotten over this anxiety around employment when I got my first job, even the early period of post-October 2024 unemployment was not that anxious, but it's come back in a really big way recently with everything that's been in the news.

I'm crying and I can tell I'm spiraling all over the place as I write this so I better stop now before I get too incoherent. Can someone please just say something nice to me? Do you think it sounds like I'm doing ok with my job hunt? I really need someone to tell me I'm doing ok and not being lazy. Please please just anything nice? I really need it.

They're not graphic or detailed descriptions but I will still put the trigger warning there in case anybody needs it. I'm not good at describing stuff so apologies if some parts sound awkward.

I was feeling pretty normal the other day and I went to school like always, but then partway through class, the teacher had shown us a video about a disease and how it affects the human body. I feel incredible distress and anxiety at discussions of deadly diseases or viruses even if my chances of contracting the disease are slim. I hadn't communicated this to my teacher prior to this because, honestly, it was never this bad before. I'd get scared and nervous and then I'd settle down soon enough. But watching the video made me start to feel queasy and scared, and I began feeling terrified that I would end up with the disease or that someone I love would get it, even though it's rare (don't remember which disease it was. I was kinda trying to tune things out to calm myself down. I just know that it's a rare disease). It got so bad I thought I was going to throw up so I held myself together the best I could and excused myself to the bathroom. But on my way there my vision started to get blurry and I remember trying to steady myself on the wall before I was suddenly opening my eyes on the ground. I fainted but it clearly wasn't for long since nobody seemed to have noticed.

Now, days after, I have been completely fine at home, but always right before I go to school or when I'm at school, I feel this overwhelming nausea, lightheadedness, and my heart is always racing. My mind has started to associate school with getting sick and so now I can't even go to school without feeling like fainting. I even went home partway through the day and I felt completely fine once I was at home. I don't know what to do in this situation. I'm terrified of throwing up and I always find myself desperately texting my parents to take me home before the first class is even over.

1jflo6w,I got blackout drunk for the first time,"Hey so I drank more than I thought, I was also being bought alcohol by other people and felt like I had to take it. 

I got blackout drunk and I don't remember much of the night. I cycled home and I woke up with a few scratches and bruises and I have no idea how I got home. I had to ask the person I was with how I got home and he said I just cycled but I don't remember anything. 

I'm just feeling really anxious and uneasy about it because it's terrifying not remembering. It's been a few days but anxiety is eating away at me. The thing that's making me most anxious is there's a line of cars along the street near where I live and I don't know if I didn't hit one. I was drunk so it's a possibility that I fell onto one of the cars. I don't remember falling onto one but my anxiety is telling me it's a possibility and I cannot be sure if I did or didn't. The person I was with got a taxi home and just left me there. I have a lot of emotions right now and I'm feeling super anxious. 

I have absolutely no recollection of hitting into a car my brain just thought of it as a possibility and I have no way to confirm or deny. 

I need an outside perspective to rationalise this because I feel awful about getting blackout but also the possibility of doing something bad",2025-03-20 10:20:12,offmychest
1jflnnf,Just getting some things off my chest,"I was never really here anyway

Haven’t been for a while. My actions pantomimes of hard coded expectations and sheer expressions of a survival reflex. Resilience. Endure. The program runs on loop. Cracks visibly show at the foundation of the next iteration. How many waves can a cliff take before it goes back into the sea? until it becomes nothing but sand, formless, void of entity.



The hollow expands, wonder if it can now be seen to the naked eye? Does it bleed through the eyes of my mask? Gilded and playful, crafted of the purest heart, my finest rendition of art. Will it stand when there is nothing left behind? Will I finally be alone when it falls? 



But it won’t. It never will. Its tendrils dig deep into my skin. My self heeds its command, whenever the time it is to act, to perform, to show just how fucking functional I am. Emotions flip at the flick of a switch, the blinding glare of the spotlight, a perfect camouflage. 



Someday there will be a gathering to mourn, with plenty of tears drawn. In memory of a great show, that lasted a lifetime and beyond. They will recite their favorite episodes, highlighting some of its neatly and meticulously crafted arks. And then finally will no one ever know, the writer that was buried below.

1jflh9k,I Don't Feel Woman Enough,"I’am struggling with feeling like I’m not “woman enough” or attractive enough because of an experience that completely shattered my confidence. Every time I remember that person, I feel this mix of anger and self-hatred. I hate them for making me feel this way, but I also hate myself for letting it affect me so much. I feel like I’ll never be able to measure up to whatever standard they have in their head, and it’s exhausting. I know logically that my worth isn’t tied to someone else’s opinion of me, but it’s so hard to believe that when I’m stuck in this cycle of self-doubt. I keep comparing myself to other women, wondering why I can’t be more like them, more confident, more beautiful, more *everything*. What makes it even harder is that this experience left such a big scar on me and I hope they find the woman they need because I'm certainly not her.",2025-03-20 10:06:52,offmychest

1jfldre,I want to date someone who has a LIFE,"This such a nasty thing to think so I'm putting it here. I want to date someone who is my equal. I keep dating people with no ambition, not many skills, and all their drive comes from me pulling them along. I'm so sick of it! But this seems to be the only type of person who will ask me out.

I got asked out recently by a friend, and we get along like a house on fire most of the time, but I said no!!! Because he's jobless, can't drive, doesn't exercise unless I am taking him to exercise with me, is sleazy as hell, has literally no hobbies or talents other than watching TV, can be low-key sexist and not very understanding of what I deal with as a woman, and sometimes he randomly gets really snappy and nasty and he doesn't know why. 

And then I go out and meet people who have jobs, work out, have hobbies and are super cool, and there's no spark! Or they're not interested in me! I'm just sort of weird I guess!! It sucks so much! I want to date someone who has a LIFE. But it seems because I'm strange and a little socially awkward and nervous sometimes and probably autistic, people like that don't like me, or something. I do everything I can! I work out, I take care of my skin and my hygiene, I've got a great job and a shitload of hobbies that are growing all the time... I'm proud of all that, but the one thing I just can't fix is how I act!! I can FEEL myself being a weird little goblin freak in front of all these normal people. I wish I was different! 

I need someone who wants us to be each-others rocks, not someone who sees me as the thing that will make their life interesting. It feels like it's never gunna happen!! I hope I'm wrong!

1jfla5z,Post-graduation depression hits hard,"Warning: Might be a bit sappy and pity party-ish but I fear I'm going through it right now haha  
  
So here I am 4 years later - no idea how I got here, feeling like I stumbled through all four years of my degree hanging on by a thread and warding off a huge looming threat of all-crippling burn out threatening to come. Things were easier during the last few semesters of college, when things seemed to be looking up- I'd just gotten out of a years-long toxic relationship, gotten an internship in my field which had a very positive work environment, did extremely well with my thesis and it was really easy for me to draw out plans like, okay, after x happens and x amount of time this is what i'm going to do, etc. etc.

It was great and all, but after graduating last year I've just found myself living back in my childhood room, too burnt out to do anything (I had it coming anyway, like I said I was just hanging by a thread in college to power through to graduating), and the past months have been a haze that to me feels like it could've been weeks or months since I graduated but it all feels the same. I've been under the pressure of getting a job from my family who has some sort of quiet hatred against me because they think I've had it easier than them their whole lives so I guess to them that translates into how I should have minimal problems achieving anything else in life and any struggle I have or anything I complain about is negated because I'm The Lucky Child. My family is dysfunctional enough by itself but this situation just stacks up on everything else going on with my life and the few people I turn to for support outside of my family don't seem to understand me, going so far as trying to explain my own family dynamics to me when I try to vent about what's going on. But again, I'm so burnt out out of my mind I've just been sleeping weeks on weeks away while trying to complete my work portfolio so I can finally apply to jobs and get some pressure off my back- but it's all the same, I couldn't tell last week's Tuesday apart from this week's Tuesday.

Fast forward to now when I'm applying to jobs (I'm sure everyone knows what this is like...) and I've arguably never felt more dogshit in my life. I've heard that this is normal but I just want to talk about this more because, I don't know. I feel like a statistic. I feel like anything I've done to prepare, the hard work going into my portfolio, any of that doesn't matter. Applying to jobs feels so impersonal and it feels like all 4 years I've put into college in hopes of building some kind of better future and life for myself is condensed into an online application, several pages of a design porfolio, polite, grovelling, but just enough grovelling to not come across as pathetic, application emails to companies' HR departments. And I feel more like a ghost more than I feel anything resembling a person. 

Anyway, that's all. I'm sure one day I'll wake up in an optimistic daze and temporarily forget how life has been haha",2025-03-20 09:53:25,offmychest

I have lots to be proud of and happy about but I feel lonely even though I have an amazing and incredibly supportive group of friends and family.

Doing things how ever we want. This has led to so many inventory discrepancies and countless product mix ups and a manager who just doesn’t care. But that’s not just it

He claims he’s schizophrenic, and has called many people in his office and didn’t allow a third party then went crazy on them.

1jfkp21,"I [F18] feel kinda weird because I got called ""bossy but likable.""","Not a big issue but I don't know who to tell so.

For context, I \[F18\] am on my last year of high school (not gonna reveal where but somewhere in Asia), and we have a sort of big event / fundraiser that involves students from 4-5 sections. I'm usually put in leadership situations (class vice president, leader of my research group, member of student council, secretary and publicity officer for two different organizations), so it wasn't really a surprise for me that I was selected as one of the directors for the event. We assigned committees, assigned tasks, etc., and yesterday we had our whole-day fundraiser booth. It went pretty well and we actually raised a good amount of money so I'm proud of that. We're having another booth next week as well as the second phase of the event / fundraiser which involves dance performances.

But earlier today, one of my friends \[M18\] from another section confided in me that while he and one of their directors \[F18\] were talking about booths and our section came up, she mentioned that there was someone in our section that came off as bossy: me. The director clarified that she didn't hate the way I was bossy and in fact I was even likable; I was just ""by the book."" My friend defended me, saying that I was very serious about these things and it was natural for me to lead so I might come off as bossy. He said he told me because he wanted to be honest and id ever I wanted to talk to them, he'd back me up. I told him there was no need.

Thing is, I was acquainted with the girl who said that about me because we were both scholars and met before the year started. I began to wonder where I came off as bossy and started scrolling through group conversations. I became fixated on the fact that yesterday we were supposed to have a meeting (I arranged it), but because we didn't anticipate booth traffic being so heavy, we finished beyond the set time. I asked if we could reschedule it and they agreed. My friend added that the director said that the bossy but likable actually came from the her friends who were my classmates. So then you can imagine my mind wondering after that.

It's not actually a big concern of mine—I know I can't satisfy everybody and there's at least a ""likable"" word in there, but I can't help but remember all of the times we had group tasks and I automatically took the role of leader and began assigning tasks and deadlines. I used to be a much more lenient leader, but once high school started I became more firm. I still listen to everyone's opinions, I ask if anyone's having a hard time with their tasks, I build rapport and have a laugh with them, but I expect from them just as they expect from me: just do your work. 

I'm thankful my friends came defended me and I have no plans of confronting their section's director or finding whoever said those things because all things considered, they're pretty mild and harmless. I just feel kinda weird about myself for taking them to heart. I don't want to make a big deal of it with the rest of our friends (they know, and they'e ready to throw hands lol) and I honestly just want to get the event over with because this year HAS BEEN KILLING ME.

Here's the problem years ago I had this classmate (f) who I was friendly with, I wasn't friends with her, no particular reason really I just had other friends. This girl added me to her close friends on ig, I didn't give it too much though tbh it wasn't something out of the ordinary, one day she posted about how she got her nipples pierced with a pic of her with a shirt but the piercings being visible through the shirt, and I DIDN'T GIVE THIS TOO MUCH THOUGH FOR SOME FUCKING REASON??, fast foward some time later and she countied to post about this but with no pictures, one day she posted a topless picture, i muted her stories after that.

I feel like I cheated, I feel so guilty I could puke, I literally feel nauseous thinking about this. My memory from this time is kind of hazy so I dont recall everything perfectly, but I do know that the last post happened. Whats worse is that this wouldn't be the only incident where something like this happened because I was oblivious for some goddamn reason e.g a girl once asked for my ig I gave it to her because I didn't give it too much though, I just thought she was cool and wanted to be friends???? Like why wasn't I able to tell what was going on??? 
THIS HAPPENED AGAIN, RECENTLY, a girl asked for my ig on the bus, and after being awkward for a while I gave it to her, whats worse is that I told her that I thought her outfit was cool before getting off the bus, somehow I convinced myself that she just wanted to say that my outfit was cool. Im a fucking dumbass and I fucked everything up, my girlfriend said that if something similar to the last incident were to happen we would break up, understandably so.

I can't tell her right now because she's having a rough start to the year so I can't tell her right now to do so would be very irresponsible, but how the fuck do I go about it once I can?? Why am I such a stupid fucking asshole god. She's my first everything and I love her with all my heart, how could i be such a fucking dumbass???

1jfka7y,I am wanting to disappear after my parents shattered my dream—and my soul?,"**TW: Suicide attempt, emotional abuse**

I don’t know where to start. Maybe with the fact that I’m typing this through blurry tears, wondering if anyone out there will even care. Or if I’ll just be told, again, that I’m too *ugly* to deserve a voice.

Growing up, the only time I felt alive was on stage. In school plays, I wasn’t the quiet girl with shaky hands and a quieter heart. I was someone else—brave, loud, *seen*. My drama teacher told me I was the best in class. Not “good for a kid,” but *good*. Period. For once, I believed I mattered. That maybe, just maybe, I could turn this flicker of passion into a life.

But when I told my parents I wanted to be an actress, it was like I’d set fire to their pride. They laughed. Not the warm kind, but the kind that leaves ice in your veins. “You’re too ugly for that,” my mom said, like she was commenting on the weather. My dad piled on: “School plays mean nothing. Teachers lie to make kids feel special.” They demanded I “prove” myself—*cry in one minute, right now*—as if grief were a party trick. I wanted to scream: *You’re the ones making me cry!* But I swallowed it. I’ve swallowed so much.

Then came the fight that broke me. They cornered me, voices like knives, carving me into something small and rotten. “Everything is your fault.” “You don’t deserve to cry.” I crumpled, sobbing, and they just…watched. No comfort. No mercy. Just disgust. That night, I stared at a bottle of pills and thought, *If I vanish, will they finally see the pain they’ve poured into me?* I took six. Not enough to die, but enough to hope. I lay there, silent tears soaking my pillow, aching for *one* person to hug me and whisper, “You’re okay.”

When they found out, they didn’t ask why. They raged about how my death would’ve “embarrassed” them in front of family. Threatened to lock me away in a “mental asylum” if I ever “acted out” again. Not a single “Are you hurting?” Just shame. Shame for existing. Shame for *surviving*.

Now I’m here, hollowed out, replaying their words: *Too ugly. Too talentless. Too much.* I don’t know if I’m the asshole for wanting a dream they think is delusional. For wanting to scream when they told me to stay silent. For wanting to die when they made living feel like a punishment.

But maybe they’re right. Maybe I’m just a failed actor in a life that isn’t mine. ",2025-03-20 08:36:30,offmychest

She leaked our private messages for the whole school to see. So I have a hard time trusting people now. My sophomore year was okay to say the least my classmates were chill but I couldn’t get over the freshman year. Both the mistake I did also the fact that my “friend” leaked our private messages. Now that girl is after my friends and she successfully stole them from me. I know that my friends are not my property but she stalked me for a year to just notice that they were the only people I fully trusted. Idk what her name is but I don’t want to talk to my friends now because how she ig turned them against me. I have two options ignore everything and pursue alone or apologize for the disturbances I may have caused two years ago to the and how I am clueless about what is happening and how she turned them against me without giving any names. If you have any other options I am glad to hear. 

Ps we reported her to the school and the school failed to protect me from her again. ",2025-03-20 08:10:50,offmychest
1jfjtoj,Recovering abusive partner. Tell all.,"So I’ve come here to tell my story. 

Years ago I met my now ex gf. It was insane passion with us hooking up all the time and diving straight into things. I wasn’t ready for a relationship and I had been a fuckboy for about 2 years and really enjoyed just dating women and cutting things off a couple months into it. (I’m a good looking guy with a career and a decent dick- which led me to behave like a complete ass). So initially things were fine but she was related to a good friend and so we kept things hush hush until we couldn’t. 

6 months went by and she and I are at a point where we fight about my fuckboy behavior. (I would add women on IG and sometimes flirt but I never physically cheated so I somehow justified it all). I have a government job and also sold substances and she blackmailed me when I tried to break up with her. She had proof on video and in texts etc of the substances I sold which would definitely end my career. I realized I wanted to be a fuckboy but she wouldn’t let me break up with her. So we started a vicious cycle of cat and mouse. 

This went on for 18 months. It was brutal. Sometimes I told myself that I deserved all of this and so I should make it work. Don’t get me wrong- she was a smoke show! And I think I didn’t like her because she was calling out some serious flaws that I never wanted to deal with and yet I knew this but still wanted out. Then things took a turn. 

One night we got into it big time and we broke up (go figure) and she showed up at my house unannounced. When she came in I got so angry that I held her against the wall and told her never to come near me again and I let go. She didn’t leave. I called the cops and they escorted her out. 

After this I told myself that I was done; The toxicity just continued…

Our altercations would come back worse each time. One time she choked me on the couch and I fell to the floor coughing. I caught my breath and held her down for a few seconds telling her it didn’t feel good. 

We never hit each other. We never beat each other but we were physical against each other. 

We decided to go to therapy to figure things out. Initially it helped. But after 6 months or so I asked the therapist to facilitate our break up. That I wanted out (to go be a fuck boy again- I know I’m shitty etc but at the time it’s what I wanted.) it didn’t go over well at all. The manipulation came back and I couldn’t handle it so one day I just moved out. She was at work and I just disappeared. I had enough of the toxicity. I wanted to get help for the way I behaved and I wanted to become a better person (go me). 

She then decided to post to a Facebook page (are we dating the same guy) and I’m from a smaller town so everyone was on this damn thing and it was so bad. She told one sided versions of everything. She had cameras in her home recording every fight we ever had and she edited them to only show things where I looked bad. For example- she kept me up until 4am one night trying to “talk” and wouldn’t allow me to leave. Finally I pushed her off (no more then just actually pushing someone out of the way) to get out of the door. She sent a 10 second clip of me pushing her before I made my way to the door to every girl acquaintance that I had on Instagram/facebook. 

I left town. I just wanted out of it. She threatened to show proof of the substances I sold and I just didn’t care anymore. My bosses found out why I left but didn’t report me or (that I know of) find out about my involvement with drugs. (Which has since stopped completely). I hated this woman for not letting me go. I wanted to be single and free and just date without commitment but instead I feel I was given a life lesson to stop being so terrible. 

I moved far away from home, from friends, from family just to be able to breathe. I lost my career but I found a good job. I did put myself in 20k of debt to move but figured it was my only way out. She still calls to leave voicemails about blackmailing me. I’m afraid of facing all of this someday but I’ve been in therapy to change my ways. I want to be a good guy and a good husband someday but I’ve been painted as someone who is abusive and narcissistic and it definitely haunts me. My friends tell me to move back but I can’t. I just want to live in a new world where my old version just dies off and a new person is born. 

Judge me or share your opinion but it’s all here for the internet to read through. ",2025-03-20 07:59:18,offmychest

1jfjqng,I am suicidal after messing up the one opportunity I’ve had with the girl of my dreams,"

This is my first time writing a post like this, but I need something to actually give me some motivation. Long story short, I was so close to having sex with the girl of my dreams that I have been in love with for 2 and a half years. I haven’t even been able to like another girl since I met her. She’s perfect, she does not manipulate me like other girls I know who have used me but at the same time, she’s my best friend and also the best friend I could ask for. Anyway, the other night I do not even remember but apparently we tried to have sex and either from the pills I was on or the alcohol I could not get it up, which has never happened before, as I get my dick up quite easily. I think it could have been nerves combined with being blackout drunk and on meds but either way I feel the worst I ever have in my life. I couldn’t get it up and ran out of her house naked without any of my stuff and luckily some random person ended up driving me home after I was almost killed by their car. I missed out on the best moment of my life because of how much I chose to drink and take and I don’t think I’ve ever felt this guilty over my choices. I think this was the one opportunity I got with her after trying for years, and I have been suicidal the last couple days simply over not being able to take those moments back. What I could give for a do over. Is it wrong either way because she (we) were drunk? And am I overreacting about the whole situation? ",2025-03-20 07:52:45,offmychest
1jfjqeq,"9 years later, I still fucking hate one of my elementary teachers","It's been quite a long time since this happened, but I've just about had these thoughts bottled up for so long.

At this point, it feels like my mind has tried so hard to suppress any memory of what happened. I guess it just has to deal with me wanting to actively forget anything negative that occurred. 

As I started my first year at a elementary / middle school, I was placed into pre-algebra with multiple teachers. The idea was interesting to say the least. To keep it short, we were assigned multiple rotating teachers for our math class. Despite this, we had one main teacher who kept our class together during the start/ end of class.

I know, it's probably confusing to understand. The school I attend was meant to be ""innovative"" for teaching students. In fact, our classroom wasn't really a classroom. It was actually just a library / math center section of the building. Thus, the ""classroom"" meant transitioning to different areas of the library to teach a certain section of math. 

Anyways, I thought giving that blurb could help you understand some key details later on. At the time, I felt that going to that school was a place meant just for me. A place I could feel comfortable exploring whatever I wanted to learn. After all, it had just gotten established for ""gifted and talented"" students who got accepted.

That was until I meant my main pre Algebra teacher. At the time, I had foolishly thought he was just an outstanding guy who could help me learn so much about math. This especially was true as I was super interested in math. He even seemed super nice as he heard my ambitions for joining the school the first day of classes.

To me, I thought I found the best of both worlds. As an autistic student, I was always singled out in nearly every class I had up to this point. Socially awkward? You bet! Super focused on academics? Almost definitely. It was like I had entered another world. Whether it be engaged with mystery nonfiction books or solving long equations, I loved it.

To see a teacher acknowledge my pursuits without treating me like a pushover felt so freeing. Over the course of many weeks, we got together quite well. In some cases, he would just use me as an example for the other students as a ""role model student"".

Hell he even offered me candy whenever he noticed how well I was doing in his class. I enjoyed nearly all of it. The fact was, he really did make me start to explore other topics that weren't even math related. From time to time, he would let me and teach programming. 

In some classes, he flatput just let me do calculus / calculus 2 work. At times, he'd continue to praise me for being a ""good student"" going farther than other students.

Yet one day, it just changed. During one of our transitions to other parts of the ""classroom"", he asked me to stay with him for a bit. At first I was confused but thought he might have just wanted to show me another pack of sour patch kids he got just for me. 

He moved a little bit and told me to follow him for a bit. By this point, I had just accepted nearly all his orders without faltering. I had just assumed he was such a good teacher that he could do no wrong. 

Yet in a matter of just a few minutes, everything I knew about him suddenly soured. Without much hesitation, he looked around to see if anyone was nearby. Nobody. He looked around to see if any cameras were within viewing distance. It didn't help that even the teachers had left for other obligations.

He touched my inner thighs and started complementing me. He called me a really good student that made him super proud to have me. He continued to touch my shoulders and tried massenging me. I could see a noticeable bulge down under his pants.

I was just so confused. It felt so ""good"" yet so fucking wrong. I didn't even know what to say at the moment and just sort of froze like a deer seeing headlights for the first time. I felt so uncomfortable but didn't scream. Yet at the same time, I felt I wanted to absolutely run anywhere to avoid him.

I couldn't. I just let it all happen. Worse, I just pretended everything that just happened was normal if not special. In my eyes, I thought my body physically feeling good meant I enjoyed it. I didn't. I was so scared. 

He then told me that I should never tell anyone what we were doing. If so, that would mean I would be a ""bad student"". A student who nobody would trust. 

I believed every word he said. I cried myself so much after that. As a 5th grader who literally was socially awkward, I didn't know what to do. It got so had that I started feeling ""dirty"". ""Dirty"" for feeling so wrong for something seemingly ""special"" with my teacher. Ot got so had that I would just wash my hands with so much soap they dried out. Dried out to the point my family started getting angry for using all the soap.

To them, they thought I was wasting it all when I was already clean. But to me, I never felt clean for the sexual abuse I endured with him. Even when my skin started cracking bad, I thought it was the only way to feel any sense of cleanliness.

He would continue abusing me even if I tried avoiding him at all costs. Yet, I would still come back for the promise of him teaching me more concepts beyond pre-algbrea. My mind sort of just gaslight into believing this was acceptable as long as I could learn more.

Come near 6th grade, he announces my next math topic. Turns out, I'm still staying in pre-algebra for ""unsatisfactory"" performance to enter Algebra 1. I couldn't even believe it. I thought I was the ""good student"" for everyone to follow. And yet here he was arguing that I should still stick with him next year to improve my math.

Yet there was a saving grace I soon came to realize. Due to the setup of the classroom, it meant that I would be transitioned with one of the other math instructors. As luck would have it, he was assigned to only teach 5th graders.

Yet even afterwards, I felt actively avoiding him anyway possible. Even if it wasn't, I tried my hardest to have at least another teacher nearby to witness if anything went wrong.

I never spoke up about what I expierenced. To me, the admins already weren't welcoming of me. So to have me speak up about anything, I felt that would be the end of me.

It's been 9 years since then. I'm not sorry for him losing his teaching duties come 7th grade. I'm not sorry that he was caught in an affair with a teacher.

And I'm most defiantly not sorry I ducking hate him. As much as I hate to admit it, he's shaped me in ways I just haven't really come to terms with.

For one, he made me realize my love of computer science. But more importantly, the love of teaching students. 

Yet this has haunted me in so many ways come starting college. As it turns out, my mind really tried hard to suppress any of this happening. So much so that doing calculus proved to be rather traumatic recalling concepts and methods that monster taught me.

It especially didn't help come doing some computer science courses and just feeling flashbacks during lectures.

I feel that now though, maybe just maybe, that I'm starting to forgive myself a little bit. Forgiving my 5th grade self for what I came to endure. Even as I prepare getting ready to teach younger students for my job / classroom project, I still have a fear. 

That fear being if whether or not that I will just be like him. I know it sounds crazy, but it's something I've had to keep reminding myself that my path in education is not the same as him. That I will never be him nor abuse power like he did to me.

Even so I still ask myself from time to time

""Is it really my fault that I let this happen to me?""

1jfjit7,My brain feels like it’s on fire.,"I can’t stop feeling embarrassed. I can’t stop overthinking. I’m an overthinker. I want this to all stop. I want peace. Could please someone help me? Idk how but i can’t stop apologizing and getting embarrassed. Something is seriously wrong with me. I can’t function. My brain feels out of whack. 

I vented to my partner about how I don’t feel pretty or good enough and that I want cosmetic surgery and a nose job. I regret saying all of that because I sounded so negative and unattractive. He probably thinks I’m not confident which makes me less attractive. I’m tired of having to try to be “confident”. It’s tiring and I just want comfort. I’m sensitive. 

I’m tired of caring if I’m attractive or not. It’s fucking me up. I just want to love and accept myself truly. Nothing seems to help. I feel stuck hating myself. I do affirmations and meditation but I still am very insecure. I think I’m beautiful usually but I question my beauty from time to time like “Am I actually pretty or is it just an illusion?” I think I have a nice personality but sometimes I think I can be too much or not enough. I just want to be good enough. 

I wonder how I’m perceived a lot and it interferes with everything I do. I’m in therapy too. Idk how to ask my therapist how to overcome this. 

I’ll never be that cool confident chick that I want to be. Ive been trying to act confident but it never works. I feel like I failed and everyone saw me break down in public and perceive me as weak.

1jfjguf,I opened up a secret bank account today because I’m pissed off and kind of annoyed at my parents,"They basically treat me like a child but in a hypocritical way! In general they’re super loving and caring people to me and my brother but they’re kind of old fashioned where you live in my house my rules type thing where they don’t get the concept that I’m an adult! Plus my grandpa accidentally poked his eye out with a fork as a kid so he was always so paranoid and overprotective as an adult so it’s kind of rubbed off on my mom too. She would unlock our phones and read our messages until we were both like 18. My brother put a passcode so eventually she gave up and then I followed suit because I’m older so it’s embarrassing that the older sibling was still getting his privacy invaded for a while.

Anyway, so long story short I got a job after months of them begging and it was great until my boss said they’re unusually slow and they’ll have me come in if they need me but I guess they haven’t needed more for like a month now. So now things got tense again as I’m searching for a new job because in the meantime I still have my own money that’s legally mine and I also like to go out to eat with my cousins and I like to buy things I want. But they are so old fashioned they don’t acknowledge my age means I can do what I want with my own money so they keep yelling at me for spending money even though it’s MY MONEY! 

So I finally had enough of their stupid nonsense and yesterday I made a secret bank account and I’m slowly going to funnel money in there and soon when I start my new job I’ll have money they don’t know about secretly nestled in there plus a whole other stupid thing with some couches (long story) so I have a whole “evil” plan now lol ",2025-03-20 07:30:39,offmychest
1jfjftb,I caught my mom cheating with my uncle. Now she’s emotionally blackmailing me.,"i'm 18, and my mom is 46. we used to have a really good relationship, but one day, everything changed. she went out that day, saying it was for a hospital visit. later, she called me and asked if i wanted her to bring me any food. during that conversation, i asked where she was, and she said she was in a restaurant, waiting in line to buy me something. i said okay, and then she thought she hung up the call, but she didn’t. she forgot to.

i was still listening, and then i heard her talking to someone. i kind of recognized the voice, and then i finally confirmed that it was my uncle , my father’s younger brother. i thought, oh, they met. then my mom started making some noises i don’t even want to discuss. i was in shock, shaking, and crying when i heard it. i immediately started recording. i felt completely broken and had no idea what to do.

when she came home, i waited for my father to leave because i didn’t want to argue in front of him. he might have actually divorced her if he found out what she was doing. after he left, i made her listen to the voice recording. she acted confused, asking, “what is this?” like she had no idea. i told her, “this is your voice, you didn’t hang up, and i heard everything.”

she immediately started crying and defending herself, saying he met her at the restaurant while she was buying food and that they were just talking. i asked, “then what were those words you were saying to him?” she cried even more and kept saying she didn’t know what i was talking about, asking, “won’t you even trust your own mother?” she said things like, “what kind of son have i raised?” then she said, “okay, i won’t talk to anyone anymore since you’re doubting me. no son should ever doubt his mother like this.”

after that, things became really awkward between us. after some time, i tried to forget about it and started talking to her again. but a few months later, i found out she was calling him every day, literally every single day, and deleting the call logs. she thought i was dumb enough not to notice. i didn’t say anything because i knew she would cry again.

one thing i should mention is that my father doesn’t care about my mom or me. she’s the one who has taken care of me since childhood. she’s also very religious, which makes this even harder to believe. after praying so much to god, how could she do something like this?

one sunday, i went to my friend’s house, like i always do. after returning home, i found that my mom had locked the door. i knocked, and she spoke from behind the door, asking me to go buy salt from the store immediately. she was breathing heavily, and there was fear in her eyes. i said, “let me charge my phone first, it’s dead,” and she immediately said, “give me the phone, i’ll charge it.”

that’s when i got suspicious. i pushed the door open, and i saw someone rushing to the bedroom from the hall. i moved towards the bedroom to see who it was, but my mom ran ahead of me and shut the door before i could enter. that’s when i knew , it was my uncle. i waited in the hall in silence for a minute. then my mom came out first, looking sad.

i walked into the bedroom, but i saw no one. then i checked behind the bathroom door, and there he was. this bear-sized mf didn’t even know how to hide properly. i caught him and shouted, “who are you, and why are you here?” in a loud voice. he tried to cover my mouth with his hands, but i ran and screamed even louder.

my mom started crying. i told them both that i was going to tell my aunt (his wife) about this. my mom and my aunt are good friends. my mom immediately started crying harder, and he tried to defend himself, saying, “i just came casually to check on your mom.” bro really thought i was going to believe that bullshit.

then my mom said, “he’s drunk, that’s why he came here. i gave him water, nothing else happened, please don’t think we were doing anything wrong.” i told her to stop lying and that i was going to call my aunt. that’s when my mom started blackmailing me, saying she would kill herself if i told my aunt.

i was in complete shock. i couldn’t believe what she was saying. while we were arguing, that mf ran away. i looked at my mom and said, “how can you do this to me and my dad? are you even a mother? you’ve lost my respect. how do you expect me to see you the same way again?”

then she started making excuses, saying, “your dad never treated me well, that’s why i did this. after our marriage, i saw him (my uncle) and started liking him, and that’s how it started. please forgive me.”

i asked her, “then what about all the calls you’ve been having with him every day?” she denied it and said, “you don’t trust me.” i shouted, “trust?!?” she finally said sorry and promised she wouldn’t talk to him again.

after that, we barely spoke. she only served me food, and that was it. some days later, she told me she would die if i stopped talking to her. she said, “i love you more than anyone, son. you’re the one i care about. i can’t live without talking to you.”

slowly, i started talking to her again and tried to forget what happened. but it wasn’t easy. after that, she didn’t talk to him , at least not in front of me.

yesterday, she went to my grandmother’s house and said she wouldn’t be coming back until tomorrow. i said okay.

then, i had to attend my friend’s birthday party in a park. we moved to a plain, grassy area to cut the cake, and then i saw her. she was with him again, leaning on his shoulder and doing things i don’t even want to mention.

i was completely frozen. i was with 23 friends, in the middle of a celebration, and inside, i was dead. i didn’t know what to do. my heart felt so heavy, i wanted to cry but couldn’t.

i went home before she did. when she arrived, i asked, “why did you come today? you said you’d come tomorrow.” she said, “yeah, but i was worried about you, so i came.”

i don’t know what to do anymore. she blackmails me, then goes out with him again. it’s a cycle. i don’t know how to break it. i’m writing all this because i’m so confused. this is a really dark place she has left me in. she even promised on me, and in our family, breaking a promise like that means wishing death upon the person you swore on.

and it’s not just this uncle. she has done these things with three other uncles too. i'm dead inside after finding out what she has been doing all this time.

1jfjfdg,"I just turned 18, but I still look like a child.","For context, I was born with incredibly severe allergies, and it's honestly a miracle that I made it past my first year. I used to frequently see a couple specialized doctors, and they'd always go on about how they'd never seen a case nearly as terrible as mine. The only reason I've made it to legal adulthood is because of the medicine (will not say exactly which ones) I had to take for years, and still take now, but in smaller dosages. But when I was much younger, I was taking multiple times the typical adult dosage.

At a certain point, and I'm not entirely sure when, I stopped growing. Turns out, if your body is overloaded with corticosteroids, you it stunts your growth. And it makes it obscenely easy to gain weight. And it really fucks up your health in general, but that's not the important part.

 I literally didn't grow a single inch for years. When I entered middle school, the teachers thought I was some lost kid from the elementary school across the street. I finally started growing again when I got to 8th grade and was put on a hormone treatment, but I'm still under 5ft. I don't even have fucking pubes yet. I look like a young boy, not a young man.

I hate literally everything about it, but the worst by far is how other people treat me. I hate when people ask how old I am, because when I say my actual age they never believe me, because I sound exactly like the age I look. If they do believe me, it's only because I'm with my mother who feels the need to explain my situation to every stranger that'll listen to her. And then they look at me with pity, or discomfort. Either way, I hate it. No one has every treated me like a teen, because they either see me as a child or as some sort of fucking freak. 

I don't have any friends at school, and I know I'd have absolutely 0 chance asking out a girl. I can't stand my parents, and I just feel so fucking lonely. The only good thing is that apparently no one was ever comfortable bullying someone who looks 7 years younger than them, so I've just been left alone by literally everyone. 

I'm going to graduate this year, and I'm sure college is only going to be worse. 

I don't know. I just don't even feel human at this point. I'm so ashamed of myself and my body, and I honestly wish I could've just been born normal. I feel unlucky. Yeah I know other people have it worse but I just can't handle it anymore. That's all I guess.",2025-03-20 07:27:21,offmychest

1jfjc5b,young love lingers.,"when i was 17, i had a boyfriend that was very emotionally and sexually abusive. in order for me to get out of that terrible situation, i had to make him hate me. the only way i had left was to cheat on him. morally, i didn't want to have to, but i was almost to the point of suicide due to the things he was doing. that's when i found the person im talking about in this post today. we'll call him dan.
we were just two high schoolers. he was in my eighth period class, in which i happened to have another friend that i would complain about my boyfriend to. dan eventually joined in on the conversation, and we began our messy plan of me getting to be his girlfriend. 
at a point i had two boyfriends. but dan knew about everything. telling me what to do, helping me through the weird morality of it all, walking me through getting out of this situation safely. 
eventually, i did it. the first one decided he was done with my bs, so dan was officially my boyfriend. yippie. 
for the next 4 months, i would practically live with dan. i was severely mentally ill, practically in crisis, terrified of anything that had to do with treatment. because of how shaken up i was from my previous relationship, and because of how young i was, i was practically a hollow shell of a human. i had no interests, no hobbies, no style. i was a blank canvas, dan painted on it.
but, because the base was nothing, now i have his interests, his hobbies, his style. 
i would do anything to return to his love. the strength and power of it made me feel like the world had color. i have not seen the same technicolor rainbows that would shoot from his eyes for 2 years, and yet somehow they shine through in my daily life. it comes down to how he taught me how to play guitar, how to get through hard days when i couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't even get up to take a shower or piss. he built me up from the dust i used to be and now im back to the same pile of rubble from which he formed into a beautiful sculpture, yet the remnants of his craftsmanship still linger no matter how many times i destroy and rebuild it. he is forever ingrained in the fabric of my being.
but, i know that's not him anymore. he has new taste, has grown, has had new experiences. the man that i fell in love with, the man that healed me from a place i didn't think i could recover from, is now gone. 
i tried getting back with him once. he used me for my body, how ironic due to my first circumstance. it was never the same, and it never will be again.

1jfj9zf,I overthink,"I’ve struggled with overthinking for years. While I’ve improved compared to my past self (21m) —where I’d spiral into unrealistic, irrational fears whenever someone suddenly cut contact or something felt ""off""—I still can’t shake this habit. Even now, it drags me down in subtle, negative ways.  

A while ago, I asked a close friend I trust, “What do you think of my personality? What should I fix?” They gave me advice like, “You tend to overreact” or “Here’s how to handle X.” But deep down, I wasn’t looking for fixes. I was trying to confess that I feel clueless in navigating toxic relationships. Yet, here’s the irony: friends, strangers, even married couples come to me for help—with cars, emotional issues, gift ideas, you name it. People rely on me, yet I still see myself through a negative lens.  

Yesterday, I asked another friend, “Do you think I’m weak-willed?” They swore honestly, “No, you’re neither weak nor overly sensitive.” I know they’re right—logically. But emotionally? My brain keeps dissecting this, inventing ""proof"" that doesn’t exist. The negativity lingers.  

To cope, I change routines periodically: altering my hairstyle, rearranging my room, posting daily Instagram clips or vlogs. These small shifts help reset my mood. Still, I want to silence the noise in my head for good.  

If you’ve dealt with chronic overthinking or self-doubt: How did you break free? Any advice? Let’s talk.  ",2025-03-20 07:15:36,offmychest
1jfj9kr,I have unwanted thoughts of seriously harming my mom.,"This is a throwaway because I don’t want to seem like a fucking crazy person. Also-  I am not looking for help, as I’ve already tried everything I can (cops, cps, teachers, friends parents, etc.). I’m just here to vent. if y’all have any questions about anything mentioned here, please ask away. 

For starters: My mom is narcissistic, abusive, among many other things. Living with her feels like a prison. She has always been abusive since I was little. When I was really young (6-9) it was neglect. I remember having to beg my mom for food most days my dad was at work and my mom would just refuse and or beat me for pestering her too much. This left me to eat straight up raw food cause I didn’t know how to cook. 

Once I started growing older she started to get WAY more physical and verbal, one time hitting me “over 15 times with my belt” - her words because I needed to clean under the desk she was sitting at and kept asking for her to move (she had told me to clean under it and I couldn’t unless she moved). 

For more of an idea what it was like- my mom once beat me and told me to k!ll myself because the garage was “dirty” (there was around 5 things on the garage floor and I didn’t even make the mess). She also once beat me with a stick because I didn’t have on underwear with my pants due to sensory issues (I was 13 and autistic).

Once the pandemic hit, I was around her 24/7. This meant abuse. Daily. I couldn’t escape. This was constant verbal, emotional, and sometimes physical abuse (the physical abuse began to slow down because she was getting old and didn’t have the energy to beat the shit out of me anymore, but it was still there.) along with gaslighting. The works.

Eventually I begun to just lose it. I remember fantasizing about killing my mom in multiple gruesome ways, even having fucking nightmares about it. I would fantasize about killing myself too such as hurting myself in ways I’ve never experienced. I honestly just couldn’t take the abuse anymore and was seriously considering mvrder just to end my suffering and finally feel calm for once in my life (I didn’t go through with anything besides a few suicide attempts thank god).

Anyways now that I’m an adult, she’s resorted to taking my stuff and throwing it out, (yes I’ve called the police for this. They can’t do shit because it’s her house and she can do what she wants with the contents in it.) what seems like deliberate attempts to make me have autistic meltdowns, verbal abuse, gaslighting, manipulation, and threatening to institutionalize me for getting angry at her abuse.

Let me preface this by saying, I don’t want to hurt my mom. She doesn’t know about any of this so she doesn’t have any reason to want to institutionalize me besides the fact I’m an “inconvenience”.  

That aside, I’m going to be real. It is starting to feel like the pandemic again. I don’t know how to drive so I can’t just escape this fucking prison, nor do I have people I can hang out with to escape. Every day it’s constant fighting and craziness I can’t fucking handle. It feels like torture just existing in the same vicinity as her. Basically every day I’ve been going through autistic meltdowns cause she either threw away something irreplaceable, is berating me with insults, or just deliberately crossing my boundaries, all while I’m also not getting good sleep due to nightmares (thanks PTSD!).

Anyways during one of my last meltdowns she just pushed me to the limit. I remember just going through multiple ways of “making her feel how I feel” and I honestly fear if she keeps pushing me like this I might end up acting on my thoughts. Once again- I DO NOT WANT TO HURT MY MOM THEY’RE JUST THOUGHTS but even so I don’t know if I have the restraint to keep them as “just thoughts” you know? 

My mom is going go get therapy soon, me included, so hopefully I’ll be able to get her help as she has a ton of mental issues she’s unmedicated for, such as schizophrenia, which contributes to all this stressing me out and what not. For the time being though, I’m staying away from her as much as possible as my dad is on a business trip and won’t be able to de-escalate anything if anything happens.

1jfj93g,I’m so done with these people this is their final warnings before I completely block them!,"My family members have been driving me completely nuts lately like I’ve gotten so fed up with this garbage from everyone being such pissy petty babies that I want to scream my head off at them! 

First my stupid cousin “Steve” (his name in English) just acting like a total tool and scummy towards me every chance he gets! He’s so disrespectful and petty and vindictive and rude! I know I’m not the boss of you man but I’m still your older cousin so I demand some respect bro stop being an idiot! He’s on WAFER thin ice one more step out of line and this won’t be a normal run of the mill blocking you can make fun of me for doing I will completely cut you off and pretend you don’t exist! I will delete you off my contacts list and delete your phone number and text messages! I’ll delete you off Snapchat TikTok and Facebook and even more screwed up when I see you at church on Easter I will not acknowledge your existence I’m tired of getting stepped on by you people!

Then my cousin “Mitch” we’ll call him. We’ve been pretty chill for the most part these last few months with minimal stupid comments towards me. And with his wedding coming up I couldn’t be happier for him and his fiancé. But on Sunday when we were talking in the car and he was at my house talking to my mom, he said some extremely rude and disrespectful things about me! My parents baptized you what kind of scummy godbrother are you! I swear one more disrespectful comment like that to me and I’m cutting off your phone contact too! At the wedding I’ll casually say congratulations and not talk to you at all if it comes to that! 

Finally there’s my parents my brother and another cousin that I have some pissed off feelings for but maybe on another post I’m not in the mood to list their “transgressions” right now. 🤦‍♂️",2025-03-20 07:13:41,offmychest

Idk how he is the way he is, idk how he feels the way he does. Maybe it’s because he’s done a pretty shitty job of being a father and his kids lost interest in a place that hasn’t given them much anything. Idk, I just hate being seen like everyone else, as a pathetic weak baby. I mean I know it’s my own fault masking but society hates Psychopaths and my parents probably do more.

It’s extremely frustrating and getting to the point where i have to beg for anything sexual.. I don’t force it but it’s been like this for almost our entire relationship. I do think me being younger and also heavier set is playing a big part in this. I do have a high sex drive and he’s never ever in the mood. I’ve seen his ex’s and they’re all beautiful and skinny and i wouldn’t say i’m ugly but i am far from skinny, or at least how his ex’s look. I’m trying my best not to compare myself or anything like that but it’s hard considering there not many excuses why a man wouldn’t wanna be intimate with his loving girlfriend. We have sex once a month if i’m lucky. I’ve talked to him a million times with no change whatsoever, or he gets frustrated with me and walks away or goes for a smoke and the conversation never gets anywhere. He doesn’t go down on me… ever, when I give him oral every, single, time we do end up being intimate. I always get the typical excuses like “oh i’m tired” or “just not in the mood” of course this can happen and i’m not trying to associate trying to have sex with being angry or begging BUT i have no idea what to do anymore. It’s so hard sleeping with your significant other every single night and getting absolutely no intimacy. We do live together and breakup isn’t an option right now without one of us being homeless. I just feel so frustrated and angry and pretty much in a hole. ",2025-03-20 06:40:01,offmychest

1jfipbz,My discovery and obsession with older women,"Im 22, Im in college I discovered my attraction for older women a year ago when I first started going out to bars. Im pretty average looking, hit the gym sometimes played sports in highschool. My dating life was not that great coming out of highschool so when i was at a bar i met older ladies who were 26-30 they were just more open, they were more mature and actually having mature conversations and interactions with me compared to girls my age. This quickly drove my attention to women who were on older. Then I met this women who was 38. Had a few drinks with her and she took me to her place then some things led to the next and ended up doing the deed. Now im obsessed with older women maybe because of their maturity and more experiences, but i feel like they are way more open. Thoughts anyone?",2025-03-20 06:32:06,offmychest
1jfili9,I hate this day,"Today is my mom's birthday. I wanted to say happy birthday to her. I couldn't call her during the day because I was in college, so i sent her a happy birthday text. She replied back just a simple thank you and sent a image of her going to work.

My mom lives in another state, its very far so I didn't have the luxury to tell her in person 

I tried calling her to wish her a happy birthday, but she never responded. but then she called me later and was incredibly distant and distracted. Of course she was celebrating her birthday with relatives, but I couldn't even get a word in because she kept talking to other people.

I wanted to say happy birthday to her, but she was too distracted to even hear me, when not even 30 minutes prior my brother called her and had her full undivided attention.

it made me realize that I was never going to get that attention ever. I never did growing up but i kept trying to form a relationship with her. I remember when i used to live with her she would always be working, always telling me to go away when she was busy, yet my brothers had the privilege to even stay in the same room as her. 

I remember even more when she used to tell me i was useless, a parasite and lazy behind closed doors, like that one time she sat me down in the table and criticized me to the point i cried begging her to stop when I was 9. i didn't want believe her. or how she had my birthday wrong for 7 years yet my siblings birthdays were remembered. I remember when she wished she would have abandoned me, and that I didnt need her because ""At least you have a dad.""

Today it just made me realize I resent her. I resent the fact that she cant even set aside one minute for me to sing or congratulate her. I resent the fact she asks for my own father wellbeing over me, even though they stopped being together around that same time i turned 9-10. I hate it whenever I do call her, she spends 13 minutes talking about herself but only ask once how im doing. It sounds forced too. I resent the fact she set out to destroy me, gave me a lifelong lesson that I will never be loved, and a lesson I still believe to this day, She took my self love, and she has the privilege to say she doesn't remember those days. I resent the fact she explicitly told me she hated me before, but loved the rest of my siblings. and I resent the fact everyone else persisted that I call her, because its her birthday, and ""she would care so much if I called.""


She said she will call me back. and she never did. I hate this day so much because it made me realize that She will never love me the same way she loves everyone else, Im so sick of crying over that fact. I hate this day so much Im never calling her again. Im tired of seeking a relationship that was never there. I hope everyone is having a better day than me.

Sorry, typing all this makes me sick with embarrassment.

1jfij9c,I’m tired of letting my trauma consume and control my life,"I (34,M)never understood why I don’t feel like everyone else, I never wanted to get my license, I never wanted to move away from home, I never wanted to leave for school or have any “normal” experiences. But that’s a lie I do understand and I know exactly why. 

When I was three my mother divorced my father. He was a dead beat, never paid child support and hardly ever came around. When he would come around of course I’d be excited he’d bring gifts and what kid didn’t want their father around?

Details for me get foggy here but around age five possibly six he comes around again give a bs story about wanting to be in my life blah blah blah. My mom’s reluctant but ultimately gives in he doesn’t live with us but comes by slightly more often. Normally one of my grandparents or aunts would be at the house with us because occasionally mom would have to work nights, well one day there’s no one there but him and he offers to stay the night to watch me, that night I was raped by my own father. I don’t remember it I’ve buried it so deep in my subconscious I forgot it ever happened, until my late 20’s and I start remembering. But even though I blocked out the event it still controlled me all these years. Hell it still does, but I’m trying to change that… that’s why I’m here. 

I hate myself I hate my life and part of me feels it’s too late. I’m 34 and have nothing but pain and depression, I just found out I’m in early stages of kidney failure. Is this what life is, just a cruel joke? 

I don’t think so I think this is a wake up call to stop letting fear consume me and take control of my life. I just don’t know how or even where to start. I’m 34 with a minimal skill set of cooking for a living. I have the basis of an idea I’d love to do but in reality it’s extremely unlikely. 

And yes I have spoken to a therapist about this but I feel saying it in a more public setting will help me more than talking about it with someone one on one, if that make any sense.

If you made it this far thank you for reading, I’m not sure if this will actually help me but it’s a step. A step I never thought I’d take.

My BFF (i call her BFF even tho she has another BFF lul) is my only friend, she is my friend since highschool.   
She, her BF and I play video games almost everyday. She is also a streamer so she sometimes stream her games. But ever since she started streaming, she plays with us less and plays more with her viewers which is understandable. Her BF and I still play video games but just us, I really really love video games (it's my escape to reality).   
Her BF then started saying weird things like he wants to kiss me or something and I would tell him he has a GF and it sounds weird. I told my BFF bout it and she said it's fine coz she also flirts with her viewers (she is posing as single in her stream btw). I absolutely do not have romantic feelings to her BF even tho I'm single, he is like a brother to me.  
It escalated when we (her BF and I) were playing coop games with one of my BFF's viewer, I had so much fun with that guy and I wanted to add him as friend (i have a hard time making new friends coz anxiety), he said he doesn't want to get between me and my BFs fun, I was confused why he would assume my BFF's BF is my BF and asked him why he assumed that, he said that my BFF's BF messaged him that I was his GF.   
I got uncomfortable and confronted my BFF's BF and he apologized and said he won't do it again. I forgave him coz he is literally one of my 2 friends (lul). I told him I will block him if he will do it again tho. We still play with each other and he still flirts and I would always shut him down.

1jfi1wa,"I don't even know where to post this, so I guess I'll do it here and hope for the best.","Life in general seems to be winning the game of beating me down. I don't feel like my partner is really all that supportive, and we are drifting apart. That's not a huge shock, I should have ended things when her infidelity first happened several years ago, instead of being a pushover and suggesting of my own accord an open relationship, knowing full well so would never experience the perks of it. And she stopped it once I sucked it up and admitted O couldn't. But the relationship was never the same.

Now we have a house on our names, but are not married. Neither of us can afford to buy the other out of it.  Financially, so feel stuck.

Work is a well paying form of torture that only serves to remind me that I really don't have a social life, despite wanting to. 

My own mind makes me feel like shit, over the smallest things. Like a little inconvenience and I feel something in my desire to live just break, my sons are the probably the key reason I am still forcing myself to go through the motions every day. 

But, I don't want to feel like this. I've spoken to doctors and tried medications and at best they didn't help, and some meds made it so, so much worse.

I have the joy of working 5 more hours tonight then getting to go home and sit around until AI take my kids to school before sitting around again until work tomorrow, and my brain and the world seem to be tag teaming me. My spirit is simply broken and I hate it, and I can't let anyone I know find out because that would be worse.

Nuked all my social media accounts, either deleting them or everything posted to or interacted with from them, and that scares the hell out of me, because I don't know if I have it in me to convince myself ""just another day"" because even "" just another minute"" is getting hard, and there's not too far to go from there before I essentially just lose the last sliver of myself, and that little scrap of who I was..... I don't know if I can find it anymore.

1jfhwl4,University is killing me,"Lately, ive been struggling so much in my classes and staying focused. I just have so much content and work, and I can never seem to get it all done. I failed one of my midterms and am getting absolutely slaughtered in math.

I feel like I'm losing my connections with people, losing my ability to do my hobbies and just feeling constantly burnt out.

1jfhu1x,I feel torn,"Here’s the update from yesterday’s post. 

My coworker responded to my email to me coming clean about lying to her and she thanked me and showed support for me working on getting better. I did not lose my job (I am still on edge about it). I feel like I deserved to lose my job, I don’t feel worthy of forgiveness or sympathy for what I did to her.

My therapy session for today was rescheduled for next week and it sent me into a slight spiral. I thought to myself that this was a sign from the universe that I was a lost cause.

As of now I did a therapy worksheet I found online and have been reading through subreddits for encouragement. I am hoping to find a therapy session sooner than next week but we will see.",2025-03-20 05:29:34,offmychest
1jfhtkz,Am I ignorant and ungrateful for saying i’d like to live a tribal life in Africa?,"Now i'm not uneducated and I'm aware tribal people live in harsh conditions but I also really appreciate the simplicity and strong cultural aspects tribal people have. My friends and I were talking about how hard school is right now (we're juniors) and I said ""Sometimes I wish I lived in a tribe in Africa"" as in I like how natural that life is but I didn't literally intend like I want to live with the negatives that they have but some African tribal people genuinely seem really happy with their lives and it makes me happy. I didn't mean for what I said to be all that serious because I thought my friends understood what I meant but one of them looks at me and says ""It's giving ungrateful and privileged"". Like I wasn't even the one complaining about my life I love living in a well developed city but I just meant that in a way tribal life seems peaceful. Is that a horrible thing to say? I didn't even mean like in the financial aspect I said it as in a ""I appreciate the simplicity of it in a way"", now I'm so mad at myself because what I said was probably so ridiculous and ignorant but I said it because I love researching how different people around the world live and I thought I was educated enough to conclude that many tribal people are also indeed happy with their lives and their lives are not ""uncivilized"" but clearly i'm wrong and ignorant. I mean i'm asian and my country has tribes too that I think have very facisnating cultures that I would love to live in too. My ethnic country is a third world country though and even though it's a little unclean it's always felt like home when I visit(even though I wasn't born and raised there). I just enjoy the simplicity of humanity sometimes and I guess I'm ignorant for that? I feel so gulity now for ever saying that.

1jfhr4s,"Blackpill is real, women are unfair.","Genetics determine everything
Its responsible for persoanlity, looks, IQ the whole lot
Appearance counts for a whole lot and many judge u solely on that.

As a child everything seems limitless and possible suddenly u grow up and u realise ur just forced to a cog in a machine u dint matter.

Niw blackpill dating, I am going insane.
I am so confused and nothing makes sense 

People like what 5hey like cool 
But men are the ones bashed about  having unrealistic standards when as a dude if u not top percentile in height and size ur auto excluded?
Same scenarios different genders have different results.

Women are allowed to be awful to men 
Whether its million likes trends shaming their height or size or looks 
Go on qfw threads 
They all talking about size etc 

Average dudes try dating we dint succeed it's because of these factors 
Even if we sucess average size is not good enough for them even 

But if we speak about this then it's in our heads and dint exist 
What?? And men are obsessed nit women 

Yh ok I'll beleive that when I can say to women that only women are obssessed with weight and looks not men.

As a normal chick u can easily date and find out hey if I'm not upto the ideal standard I'm still wanted 
As a dude u find out ur not

1jfhpse,I slept with an escort today and it was a miserable experience.,"Hello everyone, 

I am [M25] and I thought it would be an absolute great idea to sleep with an escort. A little about myself to provide context I am going through a divorce and a bankruptcy at the same time. I am you know just a teeny tiny bit stressed. 
 I thought I would blow off some steam by looking for an escort you know. I wanted no strings attached kinda deal. So I find one and im super nervous because this is the first time I've done this. I walk up to the room either expecting the police or a woman. It was a Latina women who greeted me at the door. 
 I entered the room and she told me where to my shoes and my clothes and the we start getting to the stuff. It was possibly the worst the sex I have ever had in my life. It was an experience doing something with someone who is disgusted by you. I mean I'm a little on the heavy side 230 5'8. This experience has left me perplexed and shattered my reality basically. 
 I definitely did something wrong and I feel wrong for doing it. I should not of supported that kinda of action. I feel like paying someone and then them being disgusted by you was a real eye opener. I feel pathetic and I need to do better. Like I can't believe I paid someone for that. I don't feel anything against her, More power to her.

Honestly my take away is I'm very confused and ashamed of myself. ",2025-03-20 05:21:37,offmychest
1jfhn8k,Just found my wife's alt account asking for someone to meet up with her for car play in the middle of the night.,"TLDR: I've been married for 25, completely neglected me, I begged for therapy for a decade, cheated for 3 months at the 18yr mark, she found out, I tried to make amends, she made my life a living hell, took my retirement, my house, my kids but let me back like things would get better, and just tonight I found out she is meeting up with people behind my back. 

It's been a rough 5 years.. 

Background info: We've been married for 25ish years. I've always been high libido and she has always been low libido. When we first got married she said the best thing would be for me to just jerk off to porn and just slide it in when I was ready to cum. She rarely turned me down but there has never been any intimacy. She only ever allowed 3 sex positions and until year 18 I had  been able to give or receive any oral, anal, and hand/finger play. She's never initiated a kiss of hugged me. She only ever said I love you on extremely rare occasions despite my constant praise of her and her body. I wasn't allowed to make eye contact when having sex (those 3 positions made sure of that too) and wasn't allowed to see her naked. She wouldn't take showers with me either. There was absolutely no romantic connection after year 6. 

We had a bunch of kids per her wishes and I worked on the road to support her lifestyle. I made millions and paid off the house and cars. Took her entire family on vacation for $150,000 all the things. Nothing was ever enough for her. Hell there was an 8 month stretch where I worked on the road 40 days on/10 days off and she never called me once during that time. Not a single phone call. The times I called her she was always too busy to talk. Most of today nights I tasted metal but never followed through. I was so lonely and told her as much but she couldn't be bothered to care. 

I begged for us to go to therapy for the next decade and was always refused. I told her it was probably me but I had to have someone help us get better. Nope she wouldn't. Fast forward to year 18 and I had a friend tell me that I just had to ask her that I couldn't keep letting her treat me like a roommate. I honestly didn't want the answer that I already knew. He was right though I should have asked. He said fine at least give her an ultimatum and I did. I told her that we had to see a marriage counselor because I can't stand feeling so unloved. ""You'll have to divorce me before I go to a therapist"" was her response. 

Fast forward to year 18 and one day I met this woman in the store and we started chatting. She was pretty cool and we hit it off. Fast friends. I told wife and she was whatever about me hanging with her every now and then. One day she suggested that we should go on vacation together and then I knew I was in trouble but I couldn't stop my emotions. She was the first woman to EVER show any caring compassion towards me. One thing let to another and we ended up having a 3 month affair and fucked like 5 times. Wife found out and went crazy. That was 4 years ago. 

She's forced me to block all my friends and has tried to force me distance myself from my family. I tried to make things right because I didn't want to lose my family. My kids are my world and I'm their full time parent. I was always worried she would take my kids if we ever got divorced and I can't have that. So she finally agreed to therapy and on session 8 the therapist says well he seems like a great guy who did a very bad thing. He's trying to fix it anyway he can but I don't see doing anything. My wife lost it and started screaming that she's never done anything wrong. Anyways she never went back to therapy. 

Since then all she did all day was doom scroll and watch reels about how cheaters are shit. And sent them to me nonstop while I still tried to make things right. Finally over 18 months after the affair ended and just 2 days before my 40th birthday she kicked me out of the house. The house I paid off. Forced me from my kids when I was their primary caregiver. I had no more friends and no strong family ties because she forced me to stop talking to everyone. I spent my 40th birthday alone because she decided she was too unhappy with me being the stay at home parent. 

I worked for 20 years to pay for her lifestyle and all the while she would complain that things would be better when she could have a career of her own. I never wanted a crazy career and she always did so I don't know why she didn't start earlier but finally when the kids started kindergarten she went back to school. She forced me to sell all my retirement funds because she refused to take student loans. And changed her major several times. She finally graduated and had the career she always said wanted but has complained the entire time about how we don't make the money we used to and I'm a piece of shit for raising the kids instead of working. 

Anyways she let me back in the house 3 weeks later I think because the kids were worried. That was 2 years ago and now here we are. Tonight I swapped over to my alt account on Reddit and saw a post that looked shockingly like something my wife would say. Hard to describe the feeling. We have a shared account too and it mentioned that she's trying to be discreet because she doesn't want her husband to know blah blah blah. Not sure why but I swapped back over to my account that she knows about and boom I cannot see anything in that profile. I switch back to my alt account and there it all is. I switched to our shared account and nothing again. She has blocked both of the reddit accounts that she knows I have thinking I wouldn't see. 

Idk peeps. Not sure what to do. I know I should leave but she drained my life savings and has already shown before that she'll take my kids and the house. So I'd be broke, alone, and childless. Of note too I have been job hunting for 3 years now to get back out there and after several hundred applications I'm no closer to any job at all. I don't regret many things and I don't regret the cheating but I regret the day I asked her to be my gf when I was 17. What an idiot I was - she hung up the point the first time I asked. Her whole vibe was right there from the beginning. ",2025-03-20 05:16:49,offmychest
1jfhjzh,Admitting My Past,"I (16F) am admitting to the terrible things I’ve done to relieve my intense guilt that I have. I know what i’ve done is wrong, and I’ve apologized to some of the people I’ve hurt for the things that I’ve done, but I just want to get these things off of my chest. If anything I’ve done offends you, I’m truly sorry. I would never do these things now. I’ve matured and realized that what I have done is terrible and ignorant. No excuses for any of the things I’m going to say.

From the ages 12-14 I would use racial and other kinds of slurs. Now for a bit of a backstory (I’m not using this as an excuse. I promise.) I grew up hearing these words from the adults in my life. I would use the N word and the R slur. I’ve used the R slur recently to quote something that was said to me, but I never used it in a hateful way. I never used the N word towards anyone. I would use it as slang along with the people who were my friends at the time. I live in the south, so these things are VERY normalized, which they shouldn’t be. Everywhere I go people use it as a slang word, and if I hear a family member or an acquaintance use it, I will distance myself from them and tell them not to use it.  I would also (very rarely) make racist jokes, which would make my ex friends laugh. I’ve always stood up for the black community, and I never wished to hurt anyone with the things I said and did. I apologized to people of color in my real life that would be hurt to know the things I’ve done. They all forgave me, but I won’t forgive myself.

From ages 12-13 I would make anonymous accounts (on TikTok specifically) and leave very hateful comments under peoples posts. From what I remember there was only 1 person I said hurtful things to, but I’ve never brought it up to them. I didn’t know them very well then, but we’re kind of friends now, and I’m really scared to tell them that it was me, and I don’t want to make them remember the hurtful things I said. I should apologize, I know. I’m just really nervous about it. 

At age 14, I made fun of Tourette’s syndrome, and I would ignorantly “pretend” to have it. It made people laugh, yes, but it wasn’t funny. That’s a very real thing that people deal with on the daily, and the fact that I used that to get people to laugh is disgusting. I even KNOW someone that struggles with that, and I still did it. DISGUSTING. 

From ages 2-8 I would hurt animals. I’m old enough now to know that they’re living things, but the thing that really irks me about this is my parents KNEW, and they never stopped me from what I remember. I obviously don’t do this anymore, but I just needed to throw this in because I do feel very bad. 

I’m not looking for an acceptance to my apology, because I know that the things I’ve done truly do hurt. I just need to get these things out.",2025-03-20 05:10:40,offmychest
1jfhjiw,I decided not to reapply for disability if I fail this time.,"Hello, this is my first time posting here. I didn’t want to apply for disability originally.

1jfhhfm,My One Sided Love Story,"I am a young man from India,And I have suffered a hearbreak recently :).I started liking a girl 2 years ago though we spoke only  2 times and even when we spoke they weren't full blown conversations (we told Each other,Hi,Bye, Sorry,Thank you,that's it)But I still liked her,she really has something in her eyes,they are mesmerizing,She looks like the world's most beautiful woman to me when she wears her glasses,she is also a kind and loving person unlike her friends who for some unknown reasons act vindictive towards me.

I have liked her since January of 2023 and since then I have primarily only thought about her.I changed to another institution last year and Thought that I will be able to move on but bruh i didn't.After leaving the institution I saw her twice,on both the occasions she gave me mini heart attacks and was staring at me.I really tried to control my feelings for a long time but i reached a point where I couldn't stop myself from expressing my feelings to her even though I understood a possibility where she might reject me or have a boyfriend.

I wrote her an anonymous love letter(it was a pathetic choice) and sent it through my junior who lives in her building on 13 th of March. I mentioned my fake email IDs where she could respond to me by aceepting or rejecting me :).
But she did not and when I asked my junior he said that she was a bit ""surprised"" and he also said that he didn't see her proper reaction.

I thought I was prepared for the worst but honestly i wasn't. She has a boyfriend who is absolutely toxic, overpossesive and controlling. I was heartbroken 💔😭 deeply...I was out of words.My heart shattered into a million pieces when I saw a photo of her with her boyfriend where they were kissing each other.

I believe that my love for her is Pure ,i would have felt this bad if she rejected me or if she had a Good man as her boyfriend. I am feeling heartbroken because I feel that she has almost changed and he has snatched her away 😭💔😭.

I seek your support and advice in this tough time and am sharing this to feel lighter.",2025-03-20 05:06:02,offmychest
1jfhh08,"I fantasize about my ex, but we're toxic for each other","So I've known this guy, B, for like 10 years. I met him in college, and I was cheating on my hs boyfriend at the time. I know, it was SO stupid of me!! I met him off of Yikyak and I was so drawn to him. He was a bit older than me, but so smart and charismatic. We also have a lot of sexual and mental chemistry too. Anyway, he was a huge asshole to me: made fun of me for believing in God, coerced me to do sexual stuff, put me down, say that he was impressed at my mental illnesses, the usual. 

He's the kind of person who's SO smart, but they have to say something snarky, say a snippy comment, or ALWAYS have the last word. However, I wasn't always an angel to him either. I think I can push everyone's buttons and I really loved pressing his. 

So it took me a while to see the light, break up with him and get with the guy I would end up dating for a few years. (Yes, it was a different person I was cheating on my HS bf with. Yes it was SO goddamn stupid!) 

Anyway, we stayed friendly, and after longterm BF dumped me in December of 2021, we ended up reconnecting. He, truthfully, buttdialed me before I had publicly announced my relationship ending. I propositioned him for sex, and he agreed. My ex was the first person I had slept with, so I was really anxious to have sex with someone new after about 5 years. However, when it came to do the deed, he said that I was too fat and hairy (it was winter time!) so he couldn't finish the act. I was heartbroken, but still wanted to be his friend. 

We did end up fooling around another time a few months later, and that's what's making me feel some type of way. The chemistry was \*chef's kiss!!!\* It's funny because his body is nice, but his face isn't conventionally attractive. He has a nice dick too. He's the person you show a picture of to your friends and they say ""Oh!!... Really??"" He has a stupid ass laugh, but I love it.

I am currently in a relationship with my new boyfriend, A, and I am not fulfilled. We haven't had sex in about 8 months and I am so frustrated. He only really works and then plays on his PC and talks with his friends for hours and hours. I feel like it's like pulling teeth just to get him to go to dinner with me. I told him that I wish with all of my heart that he could be the other half of my power couple, and I keep comparing him to B. I am stupid for letting him move in with me because now he has squatter's rights. 

I wish I could tell all of this to B, but it would officially be the end of our friendship, the final nail in the coffin. I know if I were him and my friend told me all of that I would totally shut down. He has just been living rent free in my mind, my dreams and my fantasies. ",2025-03-20 05:05:17,offmychest

1jfh8te,i’m questioning my sexuality and i don’t know what to do,"currently i’m (20f) wondering if i’m bisexual or not. okay weird story, but yesterday i had to go to my dentist appointment and i normally see my dentist who i’ve been seeing since i was a kid. an older, but kind lady. sadly her husband passed and she’s taking time off, so i got a fill in from a sister location. this woman was younger than my original dentist but definitely older than me. and just something about the appointment was just… amazing. she was complimenting me like crazy, like every conversation or response to an answer like “oh you have some nice bracelets what do they mean” or “so where do you go for college” she would just bring it back to me and just made me feel so giddy. and she could just be being nice, i know. but something about her and i giggling in the room and gassing me up when the overseeing dental doctor or whatever come in and talk to me about my teeth just made me feel fuzzy. and after the appointment was done she walked with me to the receptionist and helped explain what i had to get done. and after that she TOUCHED MY ARM and says along the lines of “it was great meeting you/have a good day” idk i forget.

now is this gonna be a perfect story where she and i are gonna meet again and fall in love? probably not, her sister location is an hour away from my original dental office, and she could have a girlfriend/boyfriend, i didn’t ask in the first place bc i just met her and how could i ask that? duh. but i just felt all giddy today and just kept on thinking back to her and the interaction. and now im just sitting here wondering wtf am i?

now for context, ive only ever dated/interacted sexually with guys. i have kissed girls before but it was more “slumber party sleepover” ordeal and nothing else. and there were a few girl crushes ive had recently but it’s been more like “that girl is drop dead gorgeous i either want her or want to be her” ordeal. and i know when i have a crush on someone/ have an attraction for someone, as i have girl AND guy friends and know when i feel for someone and/or don’t. but i just question if i would pursue a woman romantically. and i don’t know if it’s me being straight my whole life or having that heterosexual agenda thrusted down my throat my whole life that makes me have this subconscious feeling of it. these could be girl crushes for all i know but im just confused.

not even putting my parents into the equation at the moment because i don’t know their stances on lgbt. i know they’re extremely transphobic, but they seem tolerant to gay/bi people? when that conversation comes up i’ll ask. 

but i just think about a scenario when im interacting with a girl sexually or do couple stuff and i just feel weird? like i don’t have that giddy feeling or a certain way of “yes i can see this happening” but for guys i already know if i feel for them sexually or certainly feel a “yes i can imagine myself marrying this guy or seeing  a future relationship”. and i could try dating a girl and seeing how it goes, but i also don’t want to pursue a girl just to “test the waters” because that feels wrong and i’d rather figure it out for myself before heading down that road. 

so yeah, just needed to vent or if you guys have any advice let me know. this isn’t a huge matter but obviously something is going on and i just want to figure it out. ",2025-03-20 04:50:36,offmychest

1jfh7zo,crazy how this random guy gave me more intimacy than my ex for 8 years,"Long story short, I hooked up with someone I met on tinder while we both are on vacation. I thought it was just gonna be another ONS but he stayed the night and came over again the next day, on my last day before I flew home. We spent 2 nights together and I swear he made me feel things I have never felt. The actual sex was okay, nothing out of the ordinary but the way he made me feel throughout or during it, and no it wasn't just about the foreplay, was just nothing I have experienced before and it makes me very sad because I was in a relationship with my ex for 8 years, I gave him my all but he never ever made me feel like that. Isn’t it crazy that total strangers, for just 2 days, made me feel more than the guy I used to love and sacrifice everything for and wasted 8 years of my life for. I’m sad and so disappointed by the fact those 8 years of my life I just settled what was given to me, the very bare minimum. I used to never be able to look at my ex in the eyes while we were having sex because the look in his eyes is just idk how to explain it but it felt strange and no intimacy and he also never looked at me the way this guy did. I didn’t know any better at that time so of course I thought that it was okay or just normal with my ex but I’m so glad that I got to experience something new with this guy, now that I know what to look for and what I really need and want. Letting this out here because it’s been a rollercoaster of emotions for me (got worse because my period is also right around the corner) as I’m still on a healing journey from my breakup and the trauma I have from my ex.

   my (21f) whole life my dad’s family has looked down on me even before I came out of the womb. My grandfather tried giving my dad a new truck only if my dad was able to convince my mom to get an abortion because I was going to ruin their lives.

   My grandfather was the ringleader in treating me like shit most of my life and my grandmother and father followed suit. For example; I was 8 or 9 and I had hair chalk in my hair. My grandfather called me a “fucking prostitute” and a bunch of other comments of the same nature. My dad never defended me to this man and neither did my grandmother. 

  The reason my grandparents had so much access to me was because my dad has always lived with them. They all live on disability but really they are scamming the government. My parents divorced when i was 2 or 3 because of how awful my dad’s parents were. 

   Luckily, my grandfather died on the shitter about 2 years ago I think. I literally laughed when I heard the news.

   I also want to preface my grandmother is also a POS almost to the level of my grandfather but not quite. 

   I’m currently pregnant with my first baby and this pregnancy has been extremely difficult health wise. I have an extremely rare autoimmune condition that has increased 10 fold in severity since being pregnant. I had to be admitted to the hospital and got a picc line because I flared so bad I was unable to eat or drink ANYTHING and I was rapidly losing weight. The high dose of steroids they have me on have made my bones so brittle, I can lay in bed and still wake up in the morning with a new bone fracture. 

   There is a bunch of other medical issues going on as well, but the newest and most concerning is I’ve been dealing with intermittent fits of lack of oxygen. My oxygen saturation actually drops it’s not just shortness of breath. 

   We found out last night in the ER, I have 2 large potato size masses in my chest on top of my lungs and all the doctors say it needs to be biopsied as soon as possible. The type of masses that they are is very rare and there’s a possibility it’s cancerous. Pretty much, if u google it, it’s only cancer that pops up. 

Current situation: 

   I only speak to my grandma and my dad on that side of the family. My grandma has a very hard time getting around. So, at my wedding I invited my aunt (who I haven’t spoken to in 5 years) so she could help my grandma to the restroom and I wouldn’t have to worry about it. That was the only purpose of her attending.
  
   Since my grandfather died my grandma has been playing fake “nice” with me. So, to keep the peace I occasionally update them on my health and invite her to big events like my shower. 

   I sent the invites and totally spaced on my aunt because I have no contact with her. My grandma asked about my aunts invite and I said I’d send it out. I was okay with inviting her because I remembered I need somebody to be a restroom helper for my grandma. 

   Tonight, I decided to do the nice thing and call my dad and grandma and tell them about these masses. My dad responded how I expected, he just started talking about his 25 year old girlfriend and his dancing. He has always had a hard time seeing past himself so his response was expected. 

    After the phone call with my dad I called his mother. As I was telling her about these masses and what a hell week I’ve had going to the hospital everyday; she proceeds to tell me “after the shower you need to write your aunt a personalized letter thanking her for everything she’s done for you”.

   Apparently, my aunt has expressed to my grandma how disappointed she is in me and my generation because I didn’t write her a whole personalized LETTER (not even a thank you note) for the $20 bill and blank envelope she gave me. Not even a card. WOW, a $20 bill in the last 5 years is really gonna change my life thanks so much. 

    I think while I’m telling my grandma about possible cancer was a very inappropriate time for her to express my aunts “disappointment” in my lack of a letter. 

   I was planning on sending thank you notes, but i only had 2 weeks after my wedding before my health DRASTICALLY declined. Everybody else in my life understands that we are very appreciative for the gifts, but i literally dont have it in me to write 150 thank you notes. I have so many other things to worry about right now. 

    When my grandma told me this about my aunt, it made me see red. I lost it on her and told her “I’m so sorry I’ve been focused on not dying every time i close my eyes”. I want to uninvite both of them from my shower and not speak to them again. I was just playing nice with my grandma to begin with but my life was SO much better when I was no contact with that entire family. 

    WIBTA to uninvite them and go no contact again? ",2025-03-20 04:38:24,offmychest

Otherwise, I think my depression would’ve won a couple weeks back. My goal this year is to go to as many concerts as I can. And I really can’t miss this band, they’re my favorite!!!!! Hopefully I’m okay by then and I can make some nice memories and people will actually know me and not the fake version of myself that I present to everyone. That’s really all I want.

1jfgvdo,The love of my life is engaged to someone else,"I [24M] met my ex girlfriend [25F] in college. She was the first girl I truly loved and my first real girlfriend. We dated for 4 and a half years and all the while chatted about what our lives would be like together after graduation, moving in together, getting married. 

I was young and stupid. We had an argument her moving out of state after she graduated (she’s was a year above me), this was also when covid struck and we hadn’t seen eachother in person for weeks and weeks and it boiled into me impulsively breaking up with her. It didn’t hit me what I had done until about a week afterwards, I didn’t know how to process it all and immediately shut down only leaving my apartment for food

She tried reconnecting with me almost 2 years ago and I, for some reason I can’t tell, ghosted her. I wish I answered even if it was just to see if she was okay or at least apologise for ending things abruptly

I occasionally check her instagram page to see if she’s okay. She lives in NY now while i’m still in Georgia, and she seems happy. I was holding onto a hope that i would find the courage one day to reach out to her again, I miss her so much, I’ve never loved anyone the same and have a hard time imagining a future without her.

I checked her instagram page today to see that over the weekend she got engaged. I had no idea she was in a relationship as he was not posted anywhere on her page. I’m distraught. I don’t know what to do or even how to process this. I feel creepy for being so obsessed with her when we broke up almost 4 years ago. 

I want her back so badly and now I know it’ll never happen and I just feel so hopeless. She looks so happy in the engagement photos and it makes me want to die 

I needed somewhere to rant about this and I’m sorry if it sounds like word vomit, but it’s currently almost 1am and I feel like i’m going to throw up.

1jfgukq,Am I wrong for feeling this way,"I don’t like to he way the mother of my daughter talks to her kids. She is not a bad mom by a long shot but she doesn’t know how to properly discipline her kids and in return they disobey and disrespect. For context she has 3 kids, my daughter who is 8 months old, another daughter who is 12 and a son who is 5. All they do is watch YouTube shorts and play Fortnite after school( the 5 year old). The 12 year old is really smart and maintains Mostly A’s in all of her classes but she has an attitude problem. She talks back and doesn’t do her chores. I’ve tried to build a connection with her for the short time that I will be in her life but when she disrespects her mom in I don’t know if I should say anything or just pay no mind( I always go with option 2) 

I was also a problem child growing up. I had anger problems and I put my family through the wringer ESPECIALLY my mother which is something I regret deeply. She has since forgiven me but I’ll never forgive myself for what I put her through. I guess that’s why I don’t ever tell her anything because I’ll feel like a hypocrite . I use to try and be a “role model” and correct the bad behavior but I’m not their father and I also don’t have the patience. 

The mother of my daughter also use to make reference to us having sexual relations with me in front of the 12 year old which makes me very uncomfortable, not to mention the music she listens to in front of the kids. It’s usually just that love making rnb music or club music and I’m no better because I listen to my fair share of music when ever her kids are in my car sometimes but I try and make sure it’s notifying to crazy. I’ve expressed this to her and she didn’t take it the wrong way but that’s just how she is. I want to add that we have a good relationship but sometimes I just wish that I wore a condom but then I wouldn’t have my beautiful daughter. I’ve already failed her in one of the worst ways because I’ve created a broken home. I talked to my grandma the other day because my mom has been down my back about me telling her side of the family that I have a daughter. It was hard talking to her after so long but when I told her she was ecstatic. She told me that she was “proud of me”, for what getting kicked out the military and having a kid with a women who I was just sleeping around with at the time? Why does everyone keep telling me there proud of me? Why is this shi normalized? I’m still figuring this shi out myself and now i have to be father which im not complaining about because being around my seed has changed the way i think for the better but sometimes its just all to much.",2025-03-20 04:25:19,offmychest
1jfgu8k,I had a mental breakdown tonight,"There is so much going on in my mind and so much to do. My boyfriend and I are fighting, my mom has dementia, my dad works too much, I don’t have the adequate time for my schoolwork and studies.

For context I (F31) live next my parents. My dad just got a couple teeth pulled so he can only have soft, not hot foods. I called him and asked if he wanted me to pick anything up from the store to make since his options are limited. We decided on tacos for the leftover rotisserie chicken so I stopped by the store after volunteering to get a few times. I get home and it’s 7:30. Dad just left work.

With my mom’s dementia, she can’t do much on her own. Little brother has cerebral palsy so is completely dependent on others. His bedtime is at 8 pm given it’s a school night. I get home and he hasn’t had dinner so I instantly start making that, takes about 20 minutes in total with heating and pureeing his foods. Dad gets home and starts to feed my brother (he’s very thankful I made his dinner). Afterwards I start on my parent’s dinner. My mother doesn’t eat much during the day when she’s alone so I need to ensure she gets in some good nutrition. By this time it’s almost 8:30.

I head over to my place to get some produce and just let out a scream because I am feeling so overwhelmed and the tears started rolling with no warning. I dropped to the floor and just cried for a minute then moved to my bed and let it out for another minute. I told myself to get it together and put on a happy face and walked back over to my parents. I finish cooking dinner and they started eating around 9:15. 

Great, now it’s time for my brother to get out of his wheelchair and get ready for bed. I do that while my parents are eating (my dad comes home from work aching every day and he does so much for my family). Fast forward to 9:45, done changing him and such so clean up from dinner and my brother’s lunchbox ready. At this point my dinner plate had been sitting on the counter untouched for an hour, never did eat it. 10 pm. My takes him upstairs to bed and Dad is still at the table catching up on work stuff.

Back at my place at 10:15 and realized I hadn’t washed my scrubs for clinical tomorrow so started the washer and did dishes. It is now 11 pm and because I am a dumbass and needed to let it out, my ass is sitting on the bed doing nothing typing this out. It wasn’t supposed to be this long, sorry y’all.

All the while I haven’t done a lick of schoolwork or studying since 6:30 and even then it was only a little bit. Within the next five days I have three exams and have hardly studied for each along with two assignments due. At this point I will sleep when I’m dead and end up having a stroke from all the stress. And I’m trying to lose weight but all I really want right now is some damn chocolate.

TLDR: I am a mess and very stressed out due to not having enough time to do what I need to and family relying on me",2025-03-20 04:24:43,offmychest

1jfgog4,I think something is wrong with me,"I’ve always struggled with fitting in/making friends in life, I used to blame this basically all on my anxiety but recently this has changed. I have really improved the severity of my anxiety and feel like I have made some major mile stones to the point where I would say it is very mild at best now, but this progress in life has also left me to wonder why I am the way I am. I have a few friends but I am none of their first choices, by this I mean I’m mostly a back burner friend majority of the time, unless the main person I’m friends with is having issues with her other friendships then I seem to take priority. I would understand this more if I literally didn’t nine times out of ten didn’t put my all into my friendships, like I try so hard to make sure they stay happy and that they like me, I have changed more than I think they realize jsut to make them like me and despite this I don’t seem to ever be enough. I think this is also due to the fact that I’ve come into all my friendships later in lives thanks to some events in my life. I truly don’t understand why I’m not good enough to be considered a priority. I’m tired of changing but I’m also tired of feeling so lonely so I truly don’t know what to do. I wish someone could just sit me down and tell me exactly what is wrong with me so i could work hard to change it because all I want is to be accepted and prioritized. Sorry that this is so unorganized and just a really bad rant but I’m really upset and not sure what to to do. ",2025-03-20 04:14:58,offmychest
1jfgnbu,I’m angry at my dead father,"He died over 2 years now.  He was alcoholic my entire life and passed the illness onto me, genetically and through my upbringing. I no longer view myself as a victim or make excuses for my addiction, but I still feel if my upbringing were different that I wouldn’t have started so early. 

We were very close, I was even born on his birthday. He’d always say I was his best birthday present and I hate that I’ll never hear him say the words again. I hate that I hate my birthday now. I hate that he killed himself with his addiction and didn’t admit that he was an alcoholic until he was told they wouldn’t give him a liver. I hate that I found his dead body and I have to live with the image in my head every day. 

I’m mad that he’ll never walk me down the aisle or see my nonexistent children one day. I hate that he’s not here to give me advice on who I’m dating. I hate that he’s not here to let me keep being a victim when I fuck up. I hate that I can’t ask him for work advice because he was such a badass in his career. 

I am in a much better place today than I was this time last year. But these late nights get to me sometimes. I saw a post talking about the brain living 7 minutes after death to replay your favorite memories, I know I was a huge part of those minutes.

Because whenever I tried to communicate in the past, the person 1) doesn’t apologize 2) doesn’t see my point 3) gaslights me 4) gets defensive or doesn’t take me seriously. Thats been in relationships, close friends, and with family. I even told my dad that he hurt me and he said I was lecturing him & it went nowhere. Being passive aggressive and giving silent treatment gets a bad rep because people don’t understand that those passive aggressive people were once communicators and it’s been shut out or silenced. It is much easier because communicating my feelings doesn’t get anywhere. ",2025-03-20 04:05:45,offmychest
1jfgg7q,A person i know did an apparently fucked up thing and i totally get them,"So, the person this is about is, you could say, an internet acquaintance. I've talked to them a few times a while ago, we've played a few games together, but i've never been close to them. We do however have a few mutual friends. I'm also following them on social media, which has made me aware of them having mental health issues. I think that's all the necessary context.

For simplicity, we'll call them... Connie.

Today, i saw messages from 2 of those mutual friends, saying they were both not okay, and heartbroken and confused and whatnot. Soon after that, i recieved the context in the form of screenshots:

Connie had impersonated their own best friend (over messages) for several weeks when that friend was actually missing for all that time, and Connie still doesn't know what happened to them. They basically tried to cover up that person's disapperance by texting people under the person's name.  
Apparently, they also made those 2 mutual friends believe Connie and their best friend had been the same person from the beginning. (A detail that might be worth mentioning: Since the missing friend is a system (has DID), Connie did pretend to be a 7-year-old alter at one point.) They explained that they did this because your friend going missing is horrible, and Connie just didn't want these other friends to go through the same thing they were going through... also, they said they wanted to ""keep their best friend alive"". But they recognize what they did was wrong, and say there's no excuse.

So... i hope that explanation made sense.

Another person who was friends with them said they're going to stop talking to Connie. Everyone who knew Connie that i've heard from (even those who didn't know the missing friend, and weren't directly lied to) seem pretty upset, and seem to think it was very messed up and wrong of Connie to do this.

And here's the thing. I do see how messed up that was, and i do get why people are upset. But honestly... i can't blame Connie. Like... people do very odd things in stressful and traumatic situations. Especially considering they've been struggling with their mental health for a while... Connie didn't mean to harm anyone. They probably couldn't think it through, just felt like they had to do something. And later, as they said themself, they were just in too deep. They did admit everything now, so there's that.

I... I don't know. I feel like i should judge Connie, but i can't. I can't think of what they did as anything else than an understandable human reaction. To be completely honest, i almost want to text them now, tell them i'm on their side, and become closer to them. Just for the sake of it. Just because i feel so weird about my feelings about this.

  
(Because i'm already spilling my guts, and because it *might* provide more context: I've been feeling weird about my emotions in general lately. I feel like i don't experience most (especially negative) emotions strongly at all. I haven't gotten angry in months. When a friend of mine (unrelated to any friend i've mentioned until now) left a friendgroup server, i was sad for a mutual friend of ours because i knew this upset them... But i wasn't really sad for myself. Although i really liked the friend that left, and we've only been talking through that server. It's like... I *think* that it's horrible that i essentially just lost a friend, but i barely *feel* it, you know? The only emotional thing i've been ""good"" at lately is empathy. I do feel sad and distressed and worried for friends whenever there's a reason to. So yeah, i guess that matches the story i told here. I have empathy for Connie (as i do for all the other mentioned friends), but i can't feel angry or distressed or anything at what they did. If anything, i feel bad for them.)



TL;DR: An acquaintance impersonated their mising best friend for weeks, people are mad, i totally understand why they did it. Also i guess my empathy is way stronger than the emotions i feel for myself, which is weird.",2025-03-20 04:01:31,offmychest
1jfgfnp,"My cousin SA'd me several times when we were kids, but deep down I feel guilty that our friendship ended","When I (29M) was 5, my cousin (34M) (10 at the time) took me to the upstairs of our great grandpa's house to teach me how to French kiss. Our moms were going through our grandpa's stuff to clear out his house to sell it, so my cousin and I went off to play. I didn't understand much about kissing at the time, and had no idea what about this kind made it French, but I wanted to impress him, so I went along with it. It was gross, but like I said, I wanted impress him because he'd always been like an older brother (one I didn't often see, which made seeing him and impressing him that much more important) to me.

Over the years, we saw each other slightly more and he introduced me to The Elder Scrolls, Halo, DnD, and even taught me tricks in Ocarina of Time to get past difficult areas. All of these are games and series I frequently go back to, and I often find myself nostalgic for the good times I had with him when I play them. When my depression gets bad, I regress. These games are my usual regression anchors, and lately my depression has been eating at me.

When I was 9 and he was 14, we were downstairs at my house and he asked if I wanted to see his manhood (Idk what is and isn't allowed to say on here, so I'm gonna just use terms like these). Being a dumb 9yo, I thought it was funny and I said yes. He wanted to see mine, so I obliged. On the ride home with his parents, he told them it was my idea, so they called my mom to talk about it with her. He likely got scared I was going to bring it up to my mom, and decided to take the first shot instead. My mom asked me about it, and I described every detail, including his ""hair"" which I found funny. My mom asked how I knew he had hair down there if I had been the only one to expose himself.

My family being my family, the issue was dropped, forgotten. We still saw them, and I still looked up to him; always eager to bond with him over the newest Halo, ES, etc. It wasn't until I was in 9th grade that I stopped seeing him altogether. My mom found out that he and I had talked about smoking weed together, and that was too far for her. So, I haven't seen him since. Has to be 15-16 years now.

He has no social media presence, and I've dug fairly hard over the years. About six years ago I tried to seek him out because I was nostalgic for the good times we did have. I'm an only child and he was the surrogate older brother I always wanted, and having never had many friends, seeing him was always a highlight as a kid. I never found him online.

A couple years ago my mom and I got into it because she brought up the neighborhood perv from her childhood, and when her story was done, I mentioned my experiences with my cousin and asked if she remembered that phone call about the exposure. She asked why I was looking for him online if he'd *apparently* SA'd me (I told her about the French kissing incident that day too), and I really didn't have a good answer. I told her I wanted to catch up with him because I missed the good times we did have. Stupid answer, I know, but it was the truth. Idk if it's something adjacent to Stockholm Syndrome or what, but my guilt about our friendship ending has always outweighed the negative feelings of what he did to me. My mom told me that what he did must not have been that bad if I wanted to catch up, and something broke in me when she said that. I didn't speak to her for months.

I've had intimacy issues with my wife over the years. She's the only real relationship I've ever had apart from a couple meaningless hookups, and learning how to be intimate took a long time. It took me around five years to be comfortable kissing her, and even still sometimes I can't handle it. I've talked this all over with her, and she's been really trying to push me towards therapy, which I will go to eventually. It's so expensive, even with insurance.

I'm nostalgic for a time I thought was great, and for a person I never truly knew. I've since stopped seeking him out, and I'm letting that search die for good. That doesn't stop the ""what ifs"" though. What if we'd have stayed friends? What if those two times were it, and things would have been better? What if he's out there, struggling (his mom passed away suddenly last October), and I could be that brother for him that I always viewed him as?

I know those are dumb, and I know he fucked me up with what he did, but I can't get the guilt to go away. 

I'm sorry this was so long. My wife is the only one I've ever told all of this to, so thank you for reading through this. I don't really know how to make sense of all this.",2025-03-20 04:00:45,offmychest

1jfg956,I'm 99% sure my boyfriend is talking to other people and things already are not going great in my life.,"He uses reddit, if you see this, hi.

Anyways. Me \[20m\] and my boyfriend \[28m\] have been together for about 6 months. I have been having complete breakdowns due to the stress of not being able to secure a job for the past 2 weeks, like I am almost constantly on the verge of tears because of it. 

My boyfriend and I do not live together and in fact live in completely different states- that's why it was so suspicious to see seven ""DL"" gay male snapchat profiles in my quick add with either his states abbreviation or his area code in the username. If you don't know how quick add works, it compiles all of your friends friends into one place. 

He is the only person I have on snapchat in that state, in fact he is only one of 3 people in my snapchat all together. These profiles didn't \*just\* show up either, I've just been too scared to confront him about it sober. On two separate occasions, including this morning, he had his snaps set to disappear- which is only something that happens when you change the setting manually and is absolutely not something you can do on accident. So obviously I'm freaked out by this, I asked him about it this morning and he pulled the ""I didn't even realize that"" card on me. Come on- I'm not fucking dumb?

Whatever, I ignored it and went on with my day until a couple hours ago because truthfully, it had been eating away at me all fucking day. So I decided to screenshot all those DL profiles on my quick add and sent them to him. I said ""You can go ahead and unadd them, I'm sick of seeing them in my quick add"" he deflected saying that he wasn't friends with them, yeah okay dude- so I just told him that I hate being lied to. He ""didn't understand"" why I was being paranoid about his snaps being set to disappearing and I flat out told him that its sneaky as fuck and again told him that it can't happen on accident. He says, ""Alright but idk what to tell u. I'm also not gonna argue when I'm getting ready for bed""

I sent him a screenshot of how quick add works and told him that his good morning to me tomorrow can be a screen recording of his snap list because I want to be in a serious relationship and I'm done playing games with people. He then says, ""U need to relax."" and that is the last thing I heard from him tonight.

Now, I mentioned earlier that we live in different states but this is New England we're talking. We only live an hour away but that makes it difficult enough for us to only see each other irl every few weekends so it's not like I'm absolutely depriving him of hole yknow? I've been cheated on before in three previous relationships so I know the signs but honestly I don't want to break up with him, when he's not being an asshole I'm head over heels for him. All i want to do is make shit work out, I don't want to go back to dating because I want \*him\*.

Like he also knows that I'm pretty fucking immune to gaslighting \[victim complex bipolar mother\]- which is exactly what he just did to me- and that's driving me even crazier because I know he's just lying to me. So yeah, how to make cheating boyfriend admit that he's a piece of shit and move on with the relationship no glue, no borax?",2025-03-20 03:50:10,offmychest
1jffxs5,Feeling suicidal 💔,"Im feeling suicidal because of this 💔
I appease asked for you honestly in this situation because I truly cannot afford therapy at the moment. 

Does this make me a pervert or predator

I’ve been dealing with a lot of past trauma’s lately. Honestly I’m tired and feel overwhelmed.

I f28 am going through a lot 

Imma give you a quick run down.

I was sa from age 3-11, I repressed those memories and they came back to me at age 26.

During my preteen- teen years I tried to live a better life for me. This issue is, keeping this secret and the trauma it caused me did a lot to me that I didn’t realize until I was Older 

At age 19 or 20 I started having sexual intrusive thoughts, I thought this was normal because google said so. But honestly I gave into the intrusive thoughts. Weirdly these were things I’ve never seen or would do in my life. 

I was also anti- porn because it just not something I like. But because around this time I was hiding my depression and my hormones were like crazy I can’t explain I was just super sensitive around this time in my life. 

I gave in and decided to search porn for the first time, let’s just say I was disturbed so grossed out. The images kept replaying in my head it freaked me out. I thought I could just watch soft porn on YouTube which would be grinding videos or lap dances. Please keep in mind, I’ve never search things likes this before. Also I wasn’t aroused or turned on my any of the videos I would watch, it just was my compulsive behavior. I would search and kinda feel stuck and frozen while watching.

After that I decided this isn’t for me I don’t like this. But the seed of porn took over sadly. I would say around 25 I was angry with my past traumas asking God why, why he didn’t protect me.

It wasn’t until I was 26 I started using porn to cope with my trials. I didn’t want to feel my pain all I wanted was to not feel anything, but it’s like I was battling who I really was and who my compulsive behavior wanted me to be.

Short story, let’s just say porn fucking ruined my mind in ways I can’t explain. 

I decided to quit when I was 27 and I do feel much better but because I don’t have porn to use for coping I needed to learn new coping skills.

The reason I’m asking if I’m a pervert or predator. 

After quitting porn I realized I have severe ocd now like so bad. I had this one specific thought where it tells me I possible views someone who wasn’t legal or they were a minor and  I couldn’t tell when I watched those soft porn videos on YouTube. 

Now I’m having such huge anxiety caused God knows I would never. But because this happen when I was 19 or 20. I’m freaking out cause how about if it’s true I did that and didn’t realize at the time cause I was dealing with the early stages of my Trauma using porn sadly.

The reason I also say the predator thing because I was told that because I was sa most ppl who are sa become predators which I don’t believe but it’s really messing with my mind.

I have a hard time asking for help with this because I never see any girls talk about there porn problems.

I legit don’t even remember the videos I want he’s just like flashbacks. And I really don’t know there age and I feel I should of known better and now I feel ashamed like what would people think of me if this is true. 

I don’t know if it is, but it scares me because I’m not that kind of person and I feel I have to accept I did something I’m unsure I did.

Ik is this could just be my ocd, but also my mind keeps saying things like it satutory R*ape, I know it’s not it’s just because I was 19 and 20 and should of thought to think people could posting things like this and idk if I’m over thinking I’m just scared. 

I even fear dating because what would a guy think of me if I told him this, I’m also going through a faze where I feel I must tell everyone all my mistakes or else I’m lying and you don’t know the real me.

Does this make me a pervert?

Am I the only girls whose done this or no? 

How do I forgive myself for something I’m unsure I did, I legit can’t sleep at night constant anxiety over this? 

Like is this something you would want to know if we dated?

1jffwze,Confused with life,"Confused

Hello I'm Dan I'm a 27. I'm scared AF because I don't know what to do with my life. I know most are gonna say 27 is Young but man does it feel like I'm running out of time. 

I'll give you some background. Last year I graduated with a degree in Creative Imaging and Illustration. I've been looking for a job ever since but havnt gotten anything back, hell not even a interview. So I went back to my job I had during the pandemic. I worked in EMS for 2 years and then left due to personal issues. (PTSD) I ended up getting 2 jobs in that time one I loved but got let go, and the other one I'm a manger at to this day while workingbin EMS. Both jobs were in retail. I went back to EMS because I needed money and needed benefits. 

After graduating with my degree and not finding a job and having to go back to an old job I feel.....Lost. I have thought about going back to school but money has to be saved. I've thought about becoming a nurse, veterinarian, military, er tec, medical illustrator, pretty much anything. I've thought about alot of different opportunities, but I can never find the path I wanna go down. Which makes me scared. 

I think one of the big problems is I just feel stupid and dumb. In high-school I graduated with a 2.3. In college I graduated with a 3.3. Big difference. I know I'm not stupid but man it feels like it. I'm just scared. I feel like I'm not smart enough to look into those careers. 

Anyways sorry for the long post. This been driving me nuts and I just needed to talk about it. Thanks ",2025-03-20 03:30:35,offmychest
1jffwp8,I think I hate my best friend,"I 27f have been friends with my best friend 21f for a year now. When we first met I really did like her. We had good conversations and had a lot in common. We hung out almost every weekend and I had a lot of fun with her. When we first started hanging out she had told me she didn’t have a lot of friends and the girls she was friends with stopped liking her and I am beginning to see why. 

For background we have been texting every day, all day since becoming friends and I think this plays apart into why I’m starting to dislike her. When we first started texting we used to send memes and have actual conversations about different stuff but now it seems like we only talk about her. At first this wasn’t a big deal and people need to vent about their lives to their friends but it is mentally draining me now. 

She’s always complaining about her job, her relationship and her living situation and lack of money. These are things people usually complain about and that wasn’t an issue for me at first but the things she’s complaining about have solutions to them. 

One of her managers at her job bully’s her and constantly makes her cry and I suggested she talk to the higher up boss, say shit back, or quit. She says she wants to but doesn’t want to quit because she calls in every other week and they don’t write her up for it or fire her and she knows other jobs will. So another solution is to stop calling in all the time, but she said it’s because she gets anxiety and panic attacks and starts crying so she calls in. 

She complains about her boyfriend because he is a nonchalant emotionally unavailable asshole who always wants to hang out with his siblings and cousins instead of her. They all live in the same neighborhood and I’ve suggested that she should go hang out with them but she doesn’t want to because they talk about boy stuff. She constantly texts and calls me crying saying she tried talking to him about it but he doesn’t care and he’s not going to stop hanging out with his family and I agree that it is his family but he also should make time for her as well. 

She doesn’t want to leave him and she thinks things will get better when they get their own place together but he’s already told her he’s not planning on leaving his mom’s house. She also lives with her mom and hates it because her mom and siblings eat the groceries she buys for her lunches. I told her she should get an apartment by herself but she doesn’t want to pay rent by herself so I suggested roommates and she changed the subject. She doesn’t currently pay rent at her mom’s and I told her to start saving money now and to put it in a HYSA and she said she will but never did. She doesn’t want to give up eating out everyday so that’s why she doesn’t save. 

When we hangout in person I will be telling her a story that happened at work and she cuts me off and starts talking about whatever and this has been an ongoing thing, both in text and in person. I guess the last straw was when I was in the hospital with my husband and she asked me what I was doing and I told her we’re at the hospital and she ignored what I said and went on about her life again and it sucked. I was in a dark place at that time and it seemed pretty clear she didn’t care. 

I had and have a lot of my own shit going on and I had to stop going on social media because every time I’m scrolling there’s always something negative and fucked up happening in the world and I couldn’t take it and I can’t handle someone else’s shit anymore especially if it’s fixable and they only want to make excuses. I feel like a bad friend for talking shit but maybe she’s a bad friend too. 

We made plans to hang out next week and I am dreading it. I don’t know why she says we are best friends she doesn’t know anything about me, like favorite foods and shit like that and I honestly don’t know that shit about her either. I only know about her problems. I would be straight up with her and tell her how I feel but I know she is just going to cry and I don’t have the capacity to deal with that. 

Maybe it’s the age difference I don’t know. I don’t really know what I want from this post, I think I just needed to vent. ",2025-03-20 03:30:07,offmychest
1jfftmr,Struggling…,"I have a couple weeks before my next appointment with my therapist, and she always tells me I can just email her anytime but I just want to wait, so I can say it all out loud to her.

My first real relationship was with a guy who somehow got my phone number when I was 16. He was 24. I asked him to leave me alone repeatedly, but he always rolled back into my inbox. When I was 18, I decided after that dedication I should give him a chance. He ended up treating me like absolute shit after I agreed to marry him and bought a house with him. I left after 8 years of being together. I’m older now, and I struggle to no end with the whole circumstances of how it all happened. I struggled with substance abuse for years beginning during our relationship, and just recently got completely sober. Since getting sober, I’m dreaming again. The nightmares are intense. I don’t like talking about it because I feel like it’s all my fault and I really just got what I deserved from him. But everything surfacing in sobriety makes me think that I really need to start doing a better job of expressing this all, I just can’t figure out how. I thought this might be an easy spot to start. I hope if anyone else has been through similar things, they do a better job of dealing with everything than I did, I think I’ve done myself a real disservice over the years… I push away almost anyone that gets too close out of fear. I really just wish I would have done better.",2025-03-20 03:25:20,offmychest
1jffpwx,I genuinely want to kill myself,"The title is pretty self explanatory. I want to kill myself. I hate my body. I want to be a man, living my life as a woman feels like I’m in a living hell every day. I want to transition so bad. I want to cut my hair so bad. I want to starve myself until I die. I don’t think I can live in a world where I can’t be a man. I’m a 15 year old living in Texas and I know I will never be able to live my life as trans. There is no doubt in my mind that my mom’s side of the family will disown me and her. My dad’s side of the family might not disown me but I will face constant criticism, they already aren’t very nice. 

I’m also chronically ill and balls deep in anorexia. I see no point in living when I’m always in pain (that doctor don’t think is real) and I can’t truly be myself. 

Anyway I’m probably going to kill myself. Hope anyone reading this has a good life. Go ask out that girl/boy, go apply for that job, go study for that test, go eat that meal. It doesn’t matter in the end. Don’t forget to be kind, go hug your parents or sibling or friends and tell them you love them",2025-03-20 03:19:43,offmychest
1jffpt1,How do I get up?,I tried. I really tried. In the end it didn't even matter. I didn't try hard enough. Im so damn lonely. I've used my vocal chords maybe a handful of times this past year. Everywhere online I see that we're worth more than our grades but thats a load of horseshit. Am I really worth something?? No matter what I do I go one step forward two steps back. Everytime I do better the finish line gets pulled farther away from me. I can't win. I thought I could clutch up. I really did. I want to do engineering. I really do. I haven't had a single doubt in wanting to pursue this. Yet I wasn't there all the way. I'm in my second year. I know better. I let myself down. Truly. THIS was my chance. To prove I could be competent for once. THIS was it. I'm getting dismissed. I own up to it. I failed. I let my family down. They all trusted me. I thought I could do this. That I could retake these classes and ace them. I fucked up. Ive been trying not to blame myself but I cant help it. I fucked up. Truly. Whats one less person? One less person taking up a seat for someone that actually deserves it. I can't bring myself to do it. Lately I've thought about calling it quits. Consistently. But I can't. I can't put my family through that. I can't go leaving my little siblings. My mother. My father. But why should I keep going?? Why? I'm 19. I can't bear to face my parents. I just can't. They have every right to be livid. To disown me. Why was I stupid enough to think I had a chance? I don't want to die. I don't want to keep going either. I'm sorry. I know life is a gift. I can't be redeemed. I tried. I couldn't redeem myself. My dad hid his guns away while they left on vacation. I just want it to be fast and quick. I don't want to traumatize someone if they found me. I just want to leave without burdening anyone. I'm lower than I was before. I'm lower than square 1. Won't life go on if I left?? I keep thinking more and more of finding somewhere high. I don't want to traumatize someone from the aftermath. I don't want them to close buildings down. Someone passed and they closed down the top level of the parking garage permanently. I need therapy. I wish I had told my parents sooner. But I'm strong. I was strong. I don't know anymore. This is still lower divisions. I know I'm cut out for engineering. I'm smart. I know it. Just. Things got so much harder now. I caused this. Why should I go on knowing I'm just going to fuck up more?? I don't know how to face my dad. I love him. or my mother. I love them. All their efforts for me to crash and fail. I know I have to move forward. Thats the only way to grow. I don't have the strength right now.,2025-03-20 03:19:32,offmychest

1jff8sy,I thought I could get over having a threesome but I cant.,"My (20F) partner (23M) have always talked about the possibility of a threesome involving us + one other person. I was neutral on the idea, not thrilled but I saw nothing wrong with it at the time. This was early on in our relationship. However the longer / more serious we get into the search the less I feel like I want it because I'm satisfied and I want only him. To the point where once conversations moved off dating apps (we used my account) I'd intentionally be drier/take long to respond etc. etc. 

I'm scared to bring this up with him, as I fear that me denying him this would lead to breaking up (either due to me possibly ""decieving"" him, or something else) but every time I'm dragged into another gc with a girl it upsets me because I feel like I'm no longer enough for him and that he needs more than just me.

TL;DR - My partner wanted a threesome, i no longer do but am scared to voice this out of fear of losing him, but this has started to impact my mood.",2025-03-20 02:54:08,offmychest
1jff6ll,I don’t like talking to my friends anymore,"I dread talking to my friends. I know them from college, but it’s been a 2 years since we graduate and we’re spread pretty far out right now. Most of us are still in the same time zone but my best friend is living in a big city now. We still manage to get together once or twice a month, me, him and two of our other friends, but I just hate it now. 

We used to game, watch shitty movies, talk about our thoughts on current topics and world events, make fun of each other or whatever, but now I feel like every time we talk it’s just only about him and updates on his life. Every time it’s the same thing, talk about is the work he’s doing, the sites he’s seeing or drama around his office. Everyone else in the group loves hearing his stories. 

I feel like a piece of shit. I’m jealous because he’s out there doing amazing things, seeing the world, actually helping people, and all I can do is complain. I’m jealous because I want to talk about myself too and have my friends be worry about me, not just him, but I feel like I don’t have anything good enough to share. I’m a terrible friend, because every time he tells us a new story about what happened in his life, I just think “when will this be over”. As the months have gone on I can barely think of ways to stay engaged in the conversation. Why can’t I just be happy for him? Why am I so bitter? I’d never tell him any of this because this isn’t on him, and if I really wanted to I could just not show up to calls. 

I don’t really even know why I’m posting this, chances are pretty high he might actually see it so I’m trying to keep it vague. Maybe I do want him to see it, because I’m to much of a coward to tell him all this to his face. I just hate feeling this way and I hate myself even more.

1jfjykc,"32F/US/Okay, I wanted to post to see if there are any gamers lurking on here, willing to chat and see where things go. Let's see what you think about my video game. Please be friendly, civil, and sane when sending me a chat request.","Alright gamers, it definitely was super refreshing that many of you reached out to get to know me and left me with a lot of questions that I left out on my old post. Thanks for being friendly! Super refreshing instead of checking my inbox with hateful messages! I'm still looking to get to know introverted gamers; I'm still on the hunt, so let's go!

Do I play Borderlands? Well, the truth is this. Is this even my style of game? I'm not really sure if it is. I saw it's a first-person shooter, but I don't know if I'm really into that kind of style of first-person shooter. I mean, I've not played a shooter game in ages; the last one I had was the original Resident Evil and not the remake. I did see one of my favorite YT creators that I watch, which is Gab Smolders, and then followed by CJU, whom I'm a huge fan of literally a huge fan of his. He plays so many indie horror games that are out there, giving exposure to independent or developer themes where the crew is small. I also appreciate how honest he is with reviews; he doesn't sugarcoat things, he tells things in a positive criticism way, and he isn't afraid to put a terrible indie horror game on his title when he uploads, and Gab Smolder is the same way. Very authentic people, I should also make a dash to add that what I like about CJU and Gab Smolders as well is that their jump scares are authentic, and you can tell when CJU or Gab Smolders is really scared on screen. I also enjoy how CJU and Gab Smolders read out letters, notes, and folklorist notes in games and don't skip reading that. For me personally, when streamers do that just to breeze through the game, for people that have never played the game before, you could miss out on a lot of context clues/backstory of the video game; that's what I personally think. For me, Fatal Frame is one of them; if you don't read the folklorist notes in Fatal Frame, you will be missing out on A LOT of Japanese occult, folktales, and folklorist notes and understanding the rich history of medieval Japan. I will also imply that Fatal Frame is a foundation point of who I am today and has shaped my mindset of my interest. Along with Silent Hill, I did see on Silent Hill subreddits that some people were highly confused about what was going on, and I can understand why people would be confused. It's really a game with advanced psychological and occult subjects that are hard to gather just by thinking of theories yourself, so I can see why some people have asked the Silent Hill community subreddit, which I've joined. But I will say Silent Hill also shaped me into who I am today with the foundation. Now, once I looked back at my text the other day, I personally believe that certain Final Fantasy games are the foundations of my heart, which is why I felt so strongly to defend myself from the hateful mob the other day from that. But moving on from that, other occult games I like were the ones that CJU played that were H.P. Lovecraft games that were visual novel short stories. I highly enjoyed Dagon. Oh my, his voice was extremely awesome; the narrative of the voice felt like he could be hired as a voice actor. I've also looked at his videos of him playing Call of Cthulhu and The Sinking City.

I haven't played Skyrim in several months; I've forgotten about the game. It's funny though; I never completed the main story of the game because I wanted to complete all the side quests first, and then by the time I did that, I was burnt out and done with the game. I don't think I'll ever complete the main story.

Persona fan?

No, I'm not. I know this is going to get me downvoted galore. I'm also more into Kingdom Hearts than I am Persona games for personal reasons.

Have I played Hades?

No, I haven't. I've heard that Hades is highly not accurate, which I believe. I'm kind of scared to know what people mean by this. Because for some reason people think that the Greek Hades gets surrounded by blue Hellfire flames, or in Disney his hair has blue flames, and many want to say that the Underworld is Hell, which is not true at all. It's also not true that Hades is very angry and has an extreme temper/is violent. No, he isn't. He's stern, but I've never felt his energy to be very angry or violent in nature.

I don't know how I feel about God of War.

Apparently it's a video game about Kratos killing the Norse gods; um, okay then? Not my taste.

Assassin's Creed, yes, I've played some of the other Assassin's Creed games and Prince of Persia as well! 

Death Stranding has an amazing soundtrack, but I've only seen a Let's Play of the game, and the same goes for Ghost of Tsushima.

I never thought Hitman could hold such a touching story; I thought I wouldn't understand this game at all until I gave it a chance and decided to watch a Let's Play of this video game because I'm not really good at stealth games. But this game does have a story, and I understood it; Hitman 3 was touching.

The Last of Us is a cash grab. Unfortunately, this game didn't make me cry when watching Let's Play. I've cried on games like Yakuza games and the spinoff Judgement. I think nothing can be more heartbreaking than what happened to Majima Goro, which left everlasting trauma to me, and then you got Akira Nishikiyama that broke my heart at the end. He wanted to be good, but in the end it was too late. He should've never gone down like that, and not only that, the game Judgement was also sad, very deeply sad. Sometimes I thought, WTF? That's so wrong!  Yakuza: Like a Dragon was okay. Not a very powerful or striking story; I didn't really cry on this Yakuza series of a game. There were sad moments, yes, but I didn't cry on this one.

Street Fighter Turbo 2, yes, I've played Street Fighter Turbo 2.

I've played way too many Legend of Zelda and Super Mario games to list. 

Back when I was in my early 20s, all I did was play a lot of the DMC series. You can say DMC is and still is one of my favorite franchises to text about, same with Final Fantasy, Resident Evil, and all the other games listed thus far and any games in the community subreddits that I've joined.

Played Pokémon games up to X and Y. I can't afford the newer games and wait for them to go on sale or get a Japanese copy for cheaper and set everything to English.

Dark Cloud and Dark Cloud 2 are amazing games.

Fallout is boring; I have dozed off playing the games in my 20s.

80 percent of people hated Dragon Age Inquisition; I liked it/went gay for Anders. Hot stuff. 

I loved the BioShock series.

I've played many Final Fantasy and Tales games.

Speaking about Resident Evil 4, I was very good with the sniper gun, and I did get the broken butterfly weapon as well. I tried getting some of the bottle caps, but I never completed 100 percent of the bottle caps. I did watch a 100 percent completion guide on YT on how to complete the 100 percent bottle caps run; man, that is way out of my league. You can give me a 50 million super boss hunt like on Final Fantasy 12 Yiazmat though, haha. If people are wondering, that boss fight took me two hours and a half to complete. You need a strategy for this in your Gambit system, or you can't AFK this off-screen.

It's funny though how much I changed as a gamer though.

When I was a young one, you can say when I was about 23 or 25, I was a lax gamer. Now I'm just a lax gamer. Now I normally just stick with some fun co-op games to play with friends. I have a lot of games to play on the Nintendo Switch if anyone is interested in playing with me. I have Luigi 3, Mario Kart 8, and Mario 3D World. A friend of mine online wanted to mail me something for my birthday, and she told me that the game is going to arrive late, but she told me she wants us to play Mario Wonder/try to 100 percent complete Mario Wonder. The same online friend wants me to get Mario Jamboree Party to play with her, but I'm going to see if I can just buy a Japanese copy or a loose cartridge copy, which would be cheaper. I've played Animal Crossing, but I no longer play that game anymore. Even though my museum is 80 percent complete, I have no focus or care to complete everything, and I do have Splatoon 2/Splatoon 3, but I can't get into Salmon Run anymore. I used to be super hyped up about those two games, but not anymore. My attention span went hyped up to Nah, I don't care about these games anymore/I don't see the hype anymore. I also enjoy RPG games, and you can say that I've not played a shooter game in ages; I've not played one in like years, and I'm just a casual Nintendo and RPG gamer now basically. But I'm extremely hyped for Onimusha: Way of the Sword, but what I'm not hyped about is, man, the voice acting is so terrible in English and to me personally sounds super bad, and many people in the YT comments said this has to go in Japanese voice acting with dubbing. But I'm so excited to see Medieval Kyoto, Japan! I can't wait! I can never say no to a game with Japanese medieval lore and the Onimusha franchise!

I plan to buy the cheapest Netflix plan to see the DMC anime show if it's worth it. 

My very first gaming laptop.

I got this on sale in December in 2024 for $500 at Walmart, no joke/cap. 

ASUS TUF Gaming A15 15.6-inch FHD 144Hz Gaming Laptop AMD Ryzen 7-7435HS NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 4GB - 8GB DDR5 512 GB

We can play Fall Guys if you don't have a Nintendo Switch account. This game is more stable on the P.C. anyways. 

For more gaming details, go to your Reddit app on your mobile phone and see what gaming communities I'm in; I don't respond to/check comments. You can send a chat request if you would like. I want to be clear with people that I'm not available to meet up in person as I'm on a waiting list for a Section 8 housing apartment that will take me a year. I'm also the type of gal that is a gift giver; if this is an issue, then I don't know what to say. I always enjoy even giving my online friends from time to time a self-care package online that contains a luxurious goat milk bar for a luxurious shower, tea, and snacks. That's just me. I'm not a physical/action person; I've never been that way.",2025-03-20 08:09:59,needafriend

1jfjk0u,29m Looking for Friends – Time to post again!,"

Hey Reddit!

So, I’ve posted here a few times before, but this time I thought I’d try something a bit different. Instead of the usual “here’s why you should message me,” I’m taking a more vulnerable approach and putting myself out there a bit more.

First off – I’m looking for new friends! I’m really hoping for long-term connections. My old friend group kinda drifted apart a few months ago, and to be honest, it’s been a little lonely. I’m hoping to find some people who are up for regular chats – ideally daily – whether that’s texting, calling, or hanging out. I’m getting back into gaming, so gamer pals would be awesome, but it’s not a must! I’m super into writing stories, tabletop RPGs, camping, music, and just learning new things in general.

I’m part of the LGBTQ+ community, and I’d love to connect with people who are too. That’s not a requirement, though – it would just be a nice bonus! Also, some furry friends would be cool too (I think furries are neat, haha). 🦊

Quick note: I’m autistic, so my social skills might be a bit different from what you’re used to, but I always try my best! Communication is key, and I’m always open to learning and improving.

Now, this part is really important to me – I’ve been working hard on my mental health and am super passionate about creating a positive, caring environment in my life. If you’re someone who prioritizes kindness, empathy, and good vibes, you’ll definitely be a great fit. No room for negativity here!

One last thing – I’d prefer if you’re 21+ for a more mature vibe. I’m just looking for people who are in the same stage of life and can vibe with where I’m at.

If you’re interested, feel free to DM me or comment! I also have other apps we can move to once we’re chatting – no pressure to stay in Reddit chat! Looking forward to connecting with some awesome people. ✨

Catch you soon!",2025-03-20 07:37:38,needafriend

1jfidsw,32M My legendary friend quest continues.,"I have had the same group of friends for 10+years and I can safely say its only recently that I've realized how little I know about them.  My point of contact? I know more than I wanted to know, but everyone else in the group. I couldn't tell you what type of women they like. Favorite foods.  Colors.  None of that. 


And for some the more I learn the more disappointed I end up being.  


There's no curiosity.  No striving for growth or greater care and development of friendships.  Just endless cycle of consumption and trash talk. 


So although I need a friend. I mean. I don't  need any and all attention,  and I don't think people grasp that.   This can't keep going, but I'd rather drop them all and be at peace with my solitude.  


But.  If I can find a quality friend ?  I'll go with that instead.  


So its either. A new best friend to take on the world.  


No one at all. And thats preferred. 100%  I love doing my own thing and I have just been not doing that a lot lately.  Between running my group and studying and volunteering and socializing. And working.  And working out.  And im missing things for sure,  my plate is fl. And I don't need. More. Of. The. Same.  



I need the traits I coveted in myself so desperately.  The curiosity. The growth. The care.  


If I don't get all 3 in someone else.  I'll just.  Find someone else.  It has to be all. Or nothing.  ",2025-03-20 06:08:32,needafriend

1jfhk4j,26M - Looking for (gaming) friends!,"Hey everyone!

I'm Linus. I'm currently doing my Masters in Canada (originally from Germany). Due to the time and ping difference, it's hard for me to play with my EU friends and I'd love to find some new friends here in NA!  
I mainly play League (judge me if you want, I deserve it) Minecraft, Soulsbornes, but I'm 100% down to try anything you have in mind. I‘ve also really been wanting to get back into a MMORPG 👀.

Outside of gaming, I'm reaaaaally into music. My field of study is music related, I play a couple of instruments, and produce. I listen to anything (and I genuinely mean that, I listen to everything from Digicore to Free Jazz to Shoegaze) and love everything music related. Besides that, I love cooking, hiking, streetwear and academia - the latter in particular. Research is one of my biggest hobbies.

After my MA, I plan on doing a PhD. No idea where yet.

Shoot me a message if you're interested! I'd love to know what your favorite artist and their music means to you! :)",2025-03-20 05:10:57,needafriend

I live in the UK, specifically northern ireland

I’d enjoy talking about our days, our random thoughts, perhaps playing games together like minecraft or chess, and watching each other stream our own games

I also love exchanging music, it’s one of my favourite ways to get to know someone better, I use music a lot to help me process emotions so it’s very special to me

while I don’t have a large collection, I do enjoy literature like the works of dostoevsky and osamu dazai, if I had to name a favourite novel it would either be no longer human or crime and punishment

I’ve started to dabble in using aseprite to make pixel art, though I’m still taking my baby steps with it

1jfhg13,21 F,"Hi, 

So I’m a healthcare student (student para) in my first year - study in the north west and am from Birmingham. Pakistani Muslim and a bigger built (fat rolls, tummy, thick thighs and all). Lindors, gummy bears and all sweet things will forever be my downfall haha. Recently I’ve hit a low and would love to find something where I feel safe and secure. 

I’m nerdy and love learning new things about anyyy topics (well apart from yucky physics). I’m always down for an intellectual conversation and into watching documentaries, reading books, suduko, long walks (it’s been a while since I’ve been on them especially with it getting dark so soon…definitely not because I’m scared of the dark 😅) oooo and also want to get into manga! I’ve read deathnote but haven’t watched it yet!!

About youuu well hmmm…weaknesses are older Pakistani Muslim guys, taller than me - which isn’t too hard to beat, in a authoritative position (just something about a doctor, police officer etc in uniform that makes me weak haha), caring, kind, understanding etc. Would be great if I can geek out with someone in the healthcare sector due to similarities hehe. 🙈

 I’m hoping that I’m able to find someone who I can have a deeper connection with. No older than 32 please or anything sexual and pls be from the UK

If this is something that resonates with you then I’d love to hear an intro from you including a bit about yourself (age, where you’re from, hobbies, what you do day to day, what you’re looking for etc) as opposed to just hi/how are you

1jfgmf7,32/M,"This is very hard for me to post and I'll tell you why.

During the lockdowns I lost contact with most of my friends.  
I then moved to a different city.  
Then I took a job which has me working on my own for 12 hours a day. days and nights.  
As you can imagine, any kind of social life I had before is well and truly gone now and my social skills went along with it.

At first it was quite nice because I'm introverted and enjoyed the space and time to myself. But now I've realised that it's sending me into a depression. I do still have a handful of friends and a girlfriend. But it's not enough. As greedy as it feels to say that.

Ideally I'm looking for friends that I can chat with regularly who genuinely have the time for it. Whether it's either just shooting the shit or deep conversations.  
I'm at an age where most of my current friends are either busy with work all the time or having kids and almost forgetting we're friends all together. I'm not about that. I want a long lasting, strong friendship.

My discord is the same as my reddit name.  
Feel free to add me. I'm someone who replies almost instantly the majority of the time unless I'm asleep.

I’m 30 and just feeling like I could really use someone to talk to — whether it's about life, ideas, or just venting emotions. I guess I'm looking for a friend, someone who gets it.



Life's been feeling a little overwhelming lately. Sometimes I feel like I'm carrying a lot on my shoulders, and while I try to stay positive, there are moments when I just need someone to share my thoughts with. I don't always need advice, just someone to listen, and maybe someone who feels the same way.



I'm also planning a road trip across the USA soon. I'm excited about it, but honestly, part of me hopes I can connect with people along the way too. Exploring new places is amazing, but sharing stories, laughs, and experiences with others makes it even better.



If you're someone who enjoys deep conversations, sharing random ideas, or just wants to chat about life, I'd really love to connect. Whether it's over voice chat or just messaging back and forth, I'm open to whatever feels right.

1jflvx1,F 30 M 33 being called boring and not sure if i can stay.,"I’ve been in a relationship for years, and he used to be loving and supportive. But over the past year, he’s changed. He shifts between being affectionate and treating me like I’m worthless. He belittles me, making comments that imply I’m stupid, calling me “retarded” and “boring.” He criticizes things I do and says things like, “You talk too much, I don’t like social people.” Also that hes not sure he loves me. If I don’t “earn” his love by proving myself, he’s cold and dismissive. He even stonewalls me when I try to talk about serious topics, like our future.

But then, just when I feel completely broken, he switches back—acting like I’m everything he wants. That part of him is what keeps me staying. I feel safe and happy when he’s like that, but then it always fades, and I’m back to feeling like a burden.

I don’t think he loves me anymore, but I can’t seem to leave because I still love him. At the same time, I feel like I’m wasting my life on someone who seems unsure about me. How do you leave someone when you don’t want to give up, but you also feel like you’re slowly getting your self esteem messed up?",2025-03-20 10:35:15,relationship_advice
1jflshl,36F and 36M: What can this be?,"Over the New Years, I was vacationing with my ex when I found out he was cheating on me. We were together for 7 years and I thought headed towards a serious commitment.

Needless to say I started this year completely shattered.

A few months before this happened, I met with one of his really close college friend who was going through a rough divorce and we became really good friends as well. Once I came back, we stayed in touch and got even closer and he was the only one I told about the ordeal.

After a couple of weeks of spending time together, with dinners and movie and endless conversations, we ended up kissing after an evening of deep emotional conversation and a little bit of drunken haze and have been together since. We just completed 2 months strong.

I do not believe in rebounds as I know they rarely work long-term. But this doesn't feel like a rebound. It just feels comfortable, natural, kind of meant to be.

The last two months felt like a lifetime, with death in the family, rough divorce hearings, horrible work schedules, panic attacks, a long (10 day) vacation, my birthday and other milestones, staying together through it all. We have been intimate but neither has felt the desire to go all the way, I guess we are just happy that we have someone to hug and hold when things get rough.

I don't know if this is a situationship, a relationship, or just two drowning people holding onto each other to make it to the other side. We tried to figure it out but all could come up with is to just be thankful and appreciate each other. We are currently not even thinking what the future holds, just living in the moment and helping each other heal and grow.

Has anyone experienced this? Is it going to end in a total disaster?",2025-03-20 10:28:37,relationship_advice
1jflrul,"My (F24) boyfriend (M22) lost a sentimental ring and my dog all in one day. He left and I feel conflicted on my next steps, how do I share these feelings?","throwaway account 
I (f24) have been living with my (m22) for almost a year. I love him and it's all been going very well. When we first started dating he borrowed a ring for me with a lot of sentimental value, and very expensive. I haven't seen the ring in a while and for a while, i've been asking where it is. This is my fault for not checking, but he told me it was in the apartment and he knew it. Today I finally asked to see it. It was not in the apartment. We searched everywhere and couldn't find it, I kept asking why he wouldn't let me know sooner, and he accused me of nagging him. It ended with him finally admitting he lost it, and me calling him selfish. He has a pattern of being overly sensitive with his things but is careless with mine, high upset me. I later apologized for telling him this and told him to just keep looking for it.

I left for work and at work, he texted me he had finished looking everywhere and still hadn't found it. I had asked him to not pick up groceries and keep looking for it. He went and picked up groceries, when he got home he opened the door and was carrying things and my dog slipped out the door and ran off. He walked upstairs to drop off the groceries and then went outside, but she was gone. He texted me that she ran away. I was livid and left work. It was definitely a combo of this and the ring, because as soon as I saw him I snapped. I told him I couldn't believe he was this careless and kept asking him to tell me how it happened, because he wouldn't answer. Instead he kept making excuses and blaming my dog for running away. I ended up yelling at him for making up excuses when it didn't matter, and I definitely called him dumb for not remembering times or where she ran to, or looking for her in the first place. It was mean of me and I regret it, his brother was there also and I think that's the part that sucks. We ended up finding her two hours later. Afterwards, I kept apologizing for being mean to him, and I told him that was unfair of me and I shouldn't have snapped. Maybe I am too lenient. He pretty much said it was so embarrassing for him and that he had spent two hours looking for her and my ring so he hadn't eaten and he was tired and was going to leave to stay at his brothers because he didn't want to be near our dog ore. He said he wasn't mad at me. This completely bothered me. I told him that he wasn't the only one who was outside for two hours looking for her, and he lost MY ring and MY dog. I told him I hadn't eaten either since I was at work from 8am- 5 pm (WFH) and then at my other job from 5;30 to 8pm when he texted me. He admitted he was being selfish but wanted to be alone and said he needed to leave immediately because he didn't want to keep his brothers up and that would be selfish of him. This really bothered me because he also wouldn't ask his brothers to help him look for stuff because ""they have their own things going on"" to which I pointed out he is considerate of others but not me. He ended up leaving and later calling me to say he found the ring in his brothers guest bathroom. He had swore up and down it was at our apartment.

I feel really hurt and conflicted. I have a lot of love for him and I love him, but I feel like he is so inconsiderate and unkind to me when he causes me harm. I feel like a ""good partner"" would've set things aside and offered some comfort, because despite us being angry with each other, we should understand this was a horrible day. How can I bring this up? I don't want to break up, but I'm not sure if it's the best way to continue if he's going to just run away every time he messes up and I mess up by reacting. I'm embarrassed for yelling at him in front of his brother, and I had apologized to his brother also to which his brother said he understood and it was okay. Am I being to hard on myself? I don't want to break up, I do care about him, but I don't know how to address this situation because I don't even know how to describe it",2025-03-20 10:27:20,relationship_advice
1jflros,Why does my boyfriend ‘22M’ touch me ‘20F’ in my sleep?,"Why does my boyfriend ‘22M’ touch me ‘20F’ in my sleep? I’ve recently moved states to live with my boyfriend who i’ve been with for almost a year and this morning I woke up to him slightly grinding on me and touching me slightly but just left it because i thought maybe he was just moving around in his sleep? I woke up again not too long after to a wet patch on my pants around my butt area and him wiping the bedsheets. I’ve been in this situation twice where past relationships have touched me while sleeping and I always have the same reaction of just being in shock and pretend to be asleep so that they would just stop and realise. My sex drive is not high at all after those incidents, when my boyfriend and I first got together we had sex. I tried it out to make him happy and the experience with him wasn’t bad, I did enjoy it myself but I can’t bring myself to do it again. 

Before moving in I did tell him i’m possibly asexual (I’m still trying to figure it out myself) I have no interest in anything sexual and I get super grossed out by semen and anything along the lines of that. I do kiss and hug him but cuddling for a long time freaks me out and makes me feel trapped. He told me he understands completely and that sex in our relationship isn’t a priority at all so that made me feel very happy and secure about all of it.

After what happened this morning I pretended to fully wake up and he didn’t mention anything at all. I went to go brush my teeth and to look at my pants just to confirm and it was semen. I felt so dirty and upset that he would do this to me even though i’ve mentioned what has happened to me in the past and he thought what they did was disgusting. My boyfriend works night shifts so I was fully awake before him and he kinda stayed around in bed a lot longer than usual and eventually got up and his whole personality seemed off. I thought maybe he felt guilty about what he did but he didn’t say anything.

He’s currently at work and I don’t know if I should message him and ask him about it or what I feel very overwhelmed, gross and clueless on what to do. He’s the only person I know that lives in this state, I have no family to support me I feel extremely helpless. My boyfriend has been so sweet and kind and has helped me with so much but my brain just thinks of him as a monster now and it makes me feel horrible. ",2025-03-20 10:27:00,relationship_advice
1jflonz,"My girlfriend (19F) keeps apologizing but never changing, and I'm worried I'm (19M) the toxic one, how can I tell?","**For context**: This is the first serious relationship my girlfriend has ever been in, and her life before me has mainly been school, study, video games, sleep, and repeat.

I've been feeling deeply conflicted in my relationship lately. My girlfriend often expresses negative thoughts about herself, referring to herself with words such as “stupid” and “useless”, and every time she does, I feel like I must be unconsciously causing her to feel attacked or unloved. Despite her self-critical tendencies, she often subtly hints, or sometimes explicitly states, that I'm the reason she struggles to maintain a healthy balance between her personal time, studies, and gaming. She would subtly imply that I'm overly needy, and that our conversations, such as this one, are taking up valuable time she could otherwise spend working or gaming, as she used to before me. She would tell me that it's only because she loves me so much that she chooses to spend this time together with me rather than play her gacha games, leaving me feeling inexplicably guilty.

Recently, we had a serious discussion where I expressed my concerns, explaining how I felt saddened not only because she continues to blame herself for everything but also because she indirectly suggested that I'm holding her back and disrupting her life balance. I shared with her that I don't want her to feel obligated to keep me happy or to suppress her disagreements with anything I bring up. She then confessed she's terrified of seeing me angry or upset, which now has me questioning myself about my actions towards her. I can't even tell anymore if I'm subtly being manipulative or toxic anymore, I genuinely felt like all I’ve been doing is bringing up genuine issues that many might face in relationships. She then told me how none of her friends have ever been upset at her before, or at least never seriously, adding that she asked everyone and the general consensus was that I was being overly sensitive. This left me feeling isolated, like my concerns might indeed be unreasonable and for naught.

What's bothering me even more is her constant cycle of apologizing just to make no meaningful effort to improve or address the underlying issues. The only visible action I’ve seen from her has consisted of her creating a schedule on her calendar, which she consistently fails to follow. For example, just yesterday we discussed her need to go to the doctor tomorrow due to pain and discomfort in her lungs. She overslept today and messaged me saying she didn't have time to seek medical help because she was behind on math. At that moment, my growing concern turned into frustration, and for the first time, I texted my feelings bluntly without caring about my wording. I pointed out how she's repeatedly promised to change, yet falls back into old patterns; how she keeps blaming herself yet does not make an effort to understand why I'm upset or frustrated; how she constantly tells me I deserve someone better than her, even though it's clear I just want to be with her and for her to take better care of herself. She apologized once again, blaming herself for sleeping late and agreed to get her situation checked out, but I can't shake the feeling she's doing it just to avoid my anger rather than genuinely prioritizing her health.

I'm exhausted and frustrated, yet worried that my behavior might actually be toxic or manipulative. Am I over caring or unreasonable in my expectations? I'm emotionally drained from constantly having to act like a third parent, feeling responsible for someone else's well-being rather than being in a balanced relationship with someone capable of caring for herself. I know we’re only barely young adults, but I find myself struggling to cope and come to terms with what feels like her emotional immaturity. Is it because it's her first relationship? Is it something I'm doing without my knowledge? Or perhaps that’s just her character?

**tl;dr:** I'm emotionally exhausted by mygirlfriend's persistent self-criticism, constant indirect blaming for disrupting her routine, and her inability to follow through on promises, leaving me questioning whether my expectations are reasonable or unintentionally toxic.",2025-03-20 10:21:07,relationship_advice
1jfln3b,23F 30M Will it ever work?,"This is going to be a long one, I met this guy in November- on a dating app. Yes age is mentioned on the app but we look around the same age so I didn’t even look, neither did he. We both look 25/26ish however at the time I was 22 and he was 30. We clicked instantly as soon as we met, we discussed what we want in life etc I said I want kids in 5/6 years and he said he wants kids in 2, this is when age come up. Anyways the rest of our day together went perfect, for a few weeks later we continued to see eachother and I really opened up about my passion for wanting to become a detective ( I finish uni next year so couldn’t start my career until then) by then it will have been almost 2 years since we met- which means, no kids within his 2 year time line. However when it first come up in conversation I feel I acted really immaturely and it has happened so many times before where I’m willing to alter what I want for a man, so I said okay I’ll not become a detective I will have kids in 2 years. Obviously this is not the right thing to do and he said to me absolutely not, he won’t even let me as much as open a door when I’m with him he certainly won’t let me change my whole life plans for him. Time goes on, I admit that actually I do want to become a detective and I’m not willing to just forget about it. It has been 5 months now since we started to date and here we are, I’m worried it’s the end, even though neither of us want it to end. I have learnt so much from him and adore having him in my life, we collected his new puppy just at the weekend and took turns doing the night shifts- we work so well together he even said we would be great parents. The kids situation is the only thing we can not agree on, we have never had as much as an argument, no bickering, NOTHING it is honestly perfect when we’re together. So much has changed for me since I started to see him, we were uncertain where we would both be at the end of our current tenancies but actually we’re both going to be in the same city for a year- then I’ll move to a bigger city an hour away (he’s originally from the city I’ll move to so he’s there regularly) I would happily travel to see him. I would happily have kids in 3/4 years but I feel like if I tell him this he won’t accept it and think that I want to change my whole life because of him and he doesn’t want me to resent him later on because I’ve lost out on my 20’s.

1jflly9,i (23f) want my bf (23m) to move with me to grad school across the world…,"**i want to preface that im not delusional and i know this is a HUGE move and a big ask from him… i know… but if the roles were reversed i would do it for him. so please keep that in mind thank youuuu**

i (23F) just moved to sydney for grad school after living with my bf (23M) for 2 years in new york. we met in undergrad and have been dating ever since (5 years). he’s an amazing man, he treats me so well and is just overall a good and caring person. i love him to pieces and have always had the intention of marrying and having a future together. but ever since i got accepted to grad school, he’s been veryyyyy hesitant about what the next four years of our life would look like. originally, i moved to ny with him from oregon because he got a job there. and now that i feel like im starting on a major career path, i would like him to come with me and support me (emotionally, not financially lol) we talked about this A LOT before i left and we came to a sort of compromise that i would go alone for the first 6 months to see if i liked the program, and then after 6 months he would come (with our cat) and join me. we talked about how we could sublease our apartment/break the lease so that he could move home for a couple months to be with his family (since that was one of his concerns and fears that he would be farther away from them) and in those months he could start looking for jobs in sydney OR try to get promoted at his current job so that he could work entirely remote. that was the plan that we talked about and that i was assuming was still true up until this point. 

we have been doing really well long distance (we’ve done a little bit of it in the past) but i made it clear to him from the beginning that i don’t want a LDR for 4 years. but recently when i brought it up to check in with him and see if we were still on the same page, he seemed very hesitant and just kept telling me his fears of not being close to family and not finding a job. 1. he’s already across the country from his family so he’ll miss his family either way 2. as a 23 yr old i love being independent so I just can’t wrap my head around going back to living with my parents 3. the work excuse is logical, i get that…. BUT he hasn’t even put in the effort to look at other jobs!! he’s said that he would in january, but did that happen… no. his lack of effort and his hesitation makes me question whether he really wants to be with me and if his fears outweigh the idea of being with me, that seems like a red flag. 

so today i told him that i understand his concerns, and this decision is ultimately his to make. i told him i would not beg and plead a man to want me or choose me. in the grand scheme of things four years isn’t crazy long, so if our relationship is not enough for you to make this decision then i guess it was never strong in the first place. i left the ball in his court so we’ll see when he decides to text me… i guess im writing this to see other opinions on the situation and to see if im being too selfish. he’s truly an amazing person and has been a fantastic bf otherwise but pursuing my degree is hard enough, i don’t think ill be able to maintain a LDR on top of it. am i being fair about my reasonings??? any advice to help our situation so we don’t break up?? :,(",2025-03-20 10:15:48,relationship_advice
1jfll0e,Is my(26F) fiancé(25M) overstepping his roles as a “stepfather” with my daughter(6F)?,"Hi,
So me and my fiancé have been together for about 3 years. He met my daughter when she was 3 years old- I would also like to add that he met her WAY too early than I told him I wanted them to meet(he just showed up out of the blue- looking at this now i seem to have missed a red flag).. 


I feel like it’s important to note that my daughter’s biological father isn’t constantly in her life and is a POS. 

My daughter has her moments where she has tantrums and decides to yell at me, which I understand that she is young and needs help regulating her own emotions. My fiancé would yell at her at say things like “Do not yell at my wife like that,” “Apologize to my wife.”  He will do this while pointing at her and his tone is aggressive. When I tell him not to talk to her like that, he would say that i’m taking away his “authority.” I have mentioned to him before that I am her mother and I will always have her back no matter what. That seems to upset him. I always try to talk to him about decisions I make regarding my daughter and let him have his opinions but I do not take them into consideration. For example, I told him that I was going to put her into therapy to just talk to someone and he flat out said “no.” I told him “it doesn’t matter if you don’t want her to but i’m her mother and I get to make the decisions.” 

Side note: He has stepped up and my daughter loves him, but as our relationship goes on, I don’t think that’s enough. My daughter has just told me recently “when daddy’s mad he yells at me” (and yes she does call her dad). 

What I want to know is if this is overstepping, if his actions are weird(borderline abusive), and any advice on what I should do. 

I think I covered what’s needed to know but any questions to clarify just ask :)

1jfljy8,"Deep, loving friendship with someone (24F) in a relationship—Is it okay that I (24M) do quietly hope it could be more someday?","Hi everyone,

This might be a bit long, but I’d really appreciate some outside perspective.

&nbsp;

About a year ago, I met someone online who quickly became the most important person in my life. We formed a bond that’s difficult to describe—something deep, emotional, and incredibly safe. We talk every day, we say “I love you” regularly (and mean it), and we’ve shared an incredible amount of vulnerability, creativity, and comfort with each other. We’ve even met in person, and the connection only deepened from there. It’s not just a friendship—it feels like something more, something soul-deep.

&nbsp;

The complexity is this: she’s in a relationship. She’s been with her boyfriend since just before we met. From what I understand, there are things she values about that relationship, and I respect that. At the same time, when she’s struggling emotionally—especially with mental health—she tends to come to me. I’ve become the person she feels safest confiding in, and I know how much she appreciates the support I offer. She’s told me I make her feel seen and cared for in a way that brings her comfort and peace.

&nbsp;

She’s incredibly affectionate with me. She calls me her “soulfriend,” compares me to comfort characters she deeply connects with, and has said she’s loved me for a long time. There’s an emotional closeness that goes far beyond any friendship I’ve ever known. I’ve never directly confessed romantic feelings, but I haven’t hidden them either. I think she knows. And I think she accepts them, maybe even reflects them back in her own quiet way—though I try not to assume.

&nbsp;

I’m not trying to interfere with her relationship. I don’t pressure her, and I don’t expect anything. But quietly, I do hope that one day, if life allows and she feels ready, she might choose me—not because I ask her to, but because it feels like something real and lasting. I’m not closing myself off to other possibilities, but nothing compares to what we have.

&nbsp;

So I guess I’m asking:

**Is it okay to feel this way?**

Is it unfair to her, or to myself? Or is it okay to keep loving her in this quiet, steady way—as long as I expect nothing and always respect her choices?

&nbsp;

Thanks for reading.

1jfldas,I (22M) discovered my partner's (25F) infidelity in a previous relationship,"TW: cheating, SA

I (22M) have been dating my partner (25F) for 1 year now. I used to absolutely love her — I know she still does love me unconditionally. I have been struck with 2 thoughts however, both not that positive. Firstly, let me start off by establishing that this is my first relationship — she has been my everything ever since I've known her however, I am her 6th partner which again, is not wrong. 

Both of us know the others passwords and can access each others social media, no questions asked. The first problem is, while going through her texts with her best friend (24F), discovered that she cheated on her previous partner (25M) with someone from her college (25M) They kissed and touched multiple times over two months, but didn't have sex. I know she's remorseful and has grown from her mistakes, but loyalty is non-negotiable for me. I am big on loyalty, all I care about is loyalty, ever since I've read these chats — I am unable to look at her in the same way. She did text her best friend (these texts were exchanged right when the whole event was going on) that she feels disgusting, she wants to throw up every single second of the day but, she did do it for nearly two or three whole months. I repeat, they did not have sex. I know the way she is now, she will never cheat on me however, I'm just unable to bring myself to love her like I used to. 

Secondly, both of us had an extremely happy bedroom, however since the last 2 months, she has outright said no to sex or any intimate act for that matter. Her saying no is not related to her cheating, she was SA'ed 6 years ago due to which, she was on antidepressants, lately, she says both us being physical reminds her of the event due to which we've agreed that I'll take her to counselling and therapy this month however, I don't know how to address this with the whole her cheating on her last partner ordeal. 

How do I navigate the situation?

I wanted to ask about the situation I’m currently in: I’ve been talking to this guy (19M) for about 2 months, in the beginning we went on a date and it was amazing, just pure talking vibing and laughing. The second date happened the next week and was also very good, but from then to now It seems like I’m the only one taking initiative to plan a date, and he’s never available, which makes me insecure if he’s just keeping me around cause he’s bored. This week I convinced him to have FaceTime with me, and he seems ok, tho Hes always camera off and I’m there showing my face.

1jfla24,How do I (23F) leave my partner (26m)?,"Sorry for the format, I am on my phone!

I (23F) and my partner Sam (26M) have been together for almost 4 months. We moved in together after 2 months (too fast, I know that now).
We started out incredibly strong and deeply caring about one-another, but at some point in January we were hit with sudden financial stresses. Sam had run out of the money he had been living off and has been struggling to find work - my employment screwed me over and I had to find new work asap (which I did manage). I took on more hours at my new job, and all of my money has been going towards paying for rent, my studies and making sure we are fed. Sam has been getting government assistance income, and it first goes towards his part of the rent, then to weed, then to food. Sam has been trying to get a job, and has had no places get back to him. He is actively avoiding applying for hospitality since he doesn't want to work in customer service, but that is the ONLY field he has experience in. Needless to say, money and making sure we are fed has been destroying my mental health. When I am stressed and Sam asks me what is wrong, I say I'm just stressing about money but that we will work it all out, which has genuinely been my feelings. Sam, at the start, would immediately turn the conversation and start berating himself for not working and I would always make sure he was alright before apologising for causing him stress and reassuring him that we would find him work and that everything will be ok. Now, Sam refuses to believe the money is the main stress, and has been repeatedly telling me I'm not communicating with him and that I'm withholding stuff from him. I've tried to be open so many times and I always end up crying with how Sam reacts, to which he responds by telling me I'm trying to erase his feelings with my own.

Something new from the last month and a half: my stress levels made me less physically intimate since my drive goes down when I'm not in a good mental place. This is a fact I communicated with Sam not long after we got together. Sam has also told me that his drive increases when he is in a bad mental place, due to trauma from an ex who would apparently ridicule him and only sleep with him after she had made him cry.

Everytime I have tried to tell Sam that I am too tired or not in the mood for physical intimacy, he gets depressed and starts asking if I can do different actions to get him there. When I say no, he starts berating himself, asking if I'm withholding sex, and telling me ""I don't want to pressure you, but..."" before mentioning his trauma and guilt tripping me until we do something. I feel as though he is using his trauma as a weapon to get what he wants and I'm at a point where I don't want him to touch me. When he kisses me I unintentionally flinch. When he rubs my back I want to peel off my skin.

I was living with my sister previously, and she is in the process of moving house. My sister has a room in the new house that she has offered me to move into, and I want to accept it. I don't want to be with Sam. I don't love Sam anymore, but a part of me doesn't know how to break up with him. I feel like I'm a bad person and like I've made his life harder, and I don't want to be responsible for his mental health plummeting even more, but I just don't feel safe being with him. This is my first time living with a partner as well, and now I'm so scared and I'm realising how much harder living here is making this. I can't even move my stuff out on a day he is out of the house since he is home all day every day and can't drive.

I know I need to leave him, but if anyone has any advice as to how, that would be greatly appreciated. So, Reddit, how can I leave my partner in a safe way?",2025-03-20 09:53:11,relationship_advice

1jfl6hg,Is my partner (29 m) abusing me or am I (29f) just traumatized by my ex relationship?,"
So I was 6 years ago in a very horrible relationship where I suffered physical and psychological abuse by my boyfriend who was an alcoholic. For the next 6 years I stood single, taking therapy, trying to recover and be a better person for myself. And I think I was doing ok, I was a teacher, I have an hidroponic business, I have lots of passions and friends. Five months ago I met my now boyfriend (29 m) and he somehow convinced me to quit my job as a teacher to go sailing with him, everything seemed perfect and he seemed like a very nice person that had his life together. But when I arrived to his boat, I realized he is a very very dirty person, his lifestyle is very messy, he is a pot addict, the boat was actually broke, and everything around him was a mess too. And he got mad at me for pointing out those facts and saying I regretted quitting my job for that lifestyle. 
Anyway, he really got better at almost everything I said that was bad, reason why we kept going forward as a couple. But then he broke a lot of boundaries, he texted a girl when we were on a fight, I realized cus I saw the notifications but then realized he deleted the messages (never got to read them) but he keeps saying it was a naive conversation he only deleted them because he knew that if I saw them and realized he was talking to some girl while we were fighting I was going to get angry. He kept smoking everyday even though we had a boundary on not to. He drank alcohol like for 6 days in a row, never got drunk, but still that was a huge boundary I did mention since day ONE because remember my ex was an alcoholic so I never wanted to end up there again, also I am athlete and I never drink nor have any type of addiction, so I was looking for a partner with the same qualities, and when I asked him about that on our first dates he said he never drank alcohol nor had addictions. But next thing I know is he is drinking for days in a row with his friends. He also was so proud for saying he didn’t smoke weed no more, but then discovered he was actually eating gummies and when I confronted him he said he didn’t lied because in fact he was not smoking, he was just eating the pot. I know what you might think at this point. But let me tell you every time he did this things, he always apologized and it seemed like he really understood the issue and took accountability for it. 
Also I want to make a disclaimer on the fact that sometimes when I get really angry at him I really hurt him with my words, something I am not proud of, and trying to change, I went back to therapy, but sometimes the anger for the things he does to me is too much and I can’t really handle it in a good way. Also it triggers like all of the things my ex boyfriend used to do before abusing me. So I get very very confused, because I don’t know if my current partner is actually manipulating me and abusing me like my ex boyfriend or if I am just being triggered because I am traumatized by my last relationship. 
The other day we had an argument and then I was trying to play and be funny to make a more relaxed environment, I was on the dingy (a little boat that all big boats carry) and I accidentally let go of the big boat so I paddled back. I was laughing and telling him to grab the leash of the dingy, which he did, but when I got closer to him (he was on the big boat) he use his leg to pushed the dingy back into the water to -he says- be playful too and pretending he was sending me back into the water. The problem is that when he did that, I lost control and felt inside the dingy, and actually hurt myself. I started crying and he did said sorry just once and then asked me for space. Like if I was the one that did something wrong. We talked about it and he swore he really didn’t thought I was going to fall. He is always saying that he would never do what my ex did, that he is not like that, etc, etc, etc. but sometimes I really don’t know what to believe. Because he actually seems like a very good person but then he treats me really badly.
Our last argument was because I saw he followed a girl on IG that was just his type (I was never insecure or the jealous girlfriend type but when he deleted the messages with that girl I become very very insecure), anyway, I casually asked like “who is this?” and he said very casually too like “oh I have no idea, someone I have friends in common I think”, and that was it, we moved forward with our day, later at night we were cuddling and talking and one thing lead to the other and he admitted he actually thinks she is cute and that they added each other on social media like a month ago, but again he says he didn’t lied about knowing here because he actually doesn’t know her in person. So I  got very sad because I feel like that doesn’t matter, and I don’t care for the girl, I know they are not texting or anything, but I care for the lies he tells and how he really feels like he is not doing anything wrong. And also how easy it is for him to lie, very casually, very well performed. He makes me feel like I am really exaggerating everything. He got mad at me for saying he was a liar. And went smoking. Every time we get into a fight he smokes because he says he doesn’t care no more and that I shouldn’t control him and that he doesn’t need to prove himself to me. I agree that I shouldn’t try to control him or his addiction. The problem is that when we started dating he never mentioned that he had a problem and I also didn’t notice. And I know maybe I should have left when he broke so many boundaries. The problem is that I left my job to be with him and I feel very bad because I can’t find a new job, also my mom has terminal cancer and I feel very attached to him because although I have lots of friends I feel like no one is that close to me as he is. Although one time my mom went to the hospital, he never checked in on us, and that same day he got a job to go to Alaska and called me (while I was at the hospital) to see if I was ok with changing our plans to be together (we are long distance) and of course I got sad because remember I quit my job to be with him and first opportunity he got he is going away for two months. But at the end I supported him and his new job. But I cried a lot that day because my mom was dying and I felt like my partner couldn’t care less. Again, he did apologize for this at the end of the day and tried to make it better. He loves me a lot sometimes and he is a very nice guy most of the time. Also I don’t know if I am getting lost in translation because he is american and I am mexican, and although I speak English very well I feel like sometimes it might be a language/cultural barrier (?). I really don’t know. When I am with him I feel like everything is perfect, but when we are apart I feel like I am losing myself again for a relationship and I am really scared I am falling again for an abusive relationship. But sometimes I get the feeling that maybe is just my trauma and that I am exaggerating everything. 
He does not have a job, but every month he receives money from the government because he got in a very bad accident and he is a veteran, I only mention this because (I don’t know why) I think not having a job could be bad for mental health. He doesn’t go to therapy but he says is because he processes everything differently. He has really bad adhd so he says he is not an addict that the pot actually helps his adhd. Anyway, he is sometimes like a child, I feel like he is very innocent and that sometimes he just doesn’t realize how imprudent he is. I do love him, but I am very confused.

1jfl2vt,my (22F) boyfriend (24M) of 1 year gets burnt out because i am autistic and have high support needs. how can i make it easier for him?,"
i apologise if this is a little over this sub’s pay grade. i couldn’t really think of a more appropriate place to post this. 

i am autistic (late diagnosed) and i struggle with day-to-day things a lot more than normal people, and i also struggle with mental health issues. 
despite this, i think that my boyfriend and i have a very strong relationship. this is the second long term (admittedly not very long) relationship i have been in, and my first relationship lasted 5 years. i hid a lot of myself from my ex boyfriend and tried to maintain the facade of coping just like everyone else does, and i think it created a lot of distance between us - though it wasn’t the only reason we broke up. 

the reason i mention my last relationship is because i have been trying to be more true to myself in my current one. my boyfriend is incredibly understanding and his emotional intelligence continues to impress me. ever since we started dating, i have found that i don’t need to think much at all about how i communicate with him, because he puts effort into trying to meet me halfway and understand me. i also try my absolute hardest to do the same for him. 

the only problem is that sometimes i think this total openness can wear him down a little. because i have mental health issues, i frequently struggle with big emotions and things like that. i find it difficult to hide it when i’m feeling down or anxious even if i want to try to act like im fine for his sake. so, he notices that i am struggling and feels like he needs to help me and fix it for me. it seems to me like he puts a lot of pressure on himself to always be useful and helpful, which he tries to work on, but this has caused a bit of friction between us a few times. i think my negative emotions burn him out when he is also dealing with his own stuff. 

i get in this cycle of feeling guilty that im making him deal with all of my issues, so i start withdrawing a little and pretending im fine. but this feels very unnatural to me and i start feeling distant from him which makes me feel even worse. and then it boils over and i have a bit of a breakdown and i spill everything to him. this is always a bit of a surprise to him because of course he had no idea i was doing this at all. but in my head i have so many complicated steps of overthinking and overanalysing that i forget how irrational it must seem from the outside. 

i really don’t know what im supposed to do. maybe im just too much and maybe i will overwhelm anyone im in a relationship with. but i dont like thinking like that. so i really want to try to figure out some way i can make things easier for him, i guess. 

i apologise if i am overthinking this. i think it would be really helpful to just hear if this is normal or not. because i’m autistic i struggle with that. thank you.

Yesterday I had my off day from uni. It’s usually the only day of the week that I don’t go to school. I decided to take my time and hand make beef gyoza’s for me and my boyfriend for when he comes home from work. Today, I run errands in the morning, dreaming about the moment I’ll get back home and steam the gyoza’s that we didn’t eat yesterday. But on my way home I get a message from him that he “made a mistake” and “there are some casualties”. Turns out he tried to cook the dumplings, not knowing how to properly do so and without even thinking of asking me for instructions (or maybe googling?). First, he couldn’t turn on the stove on, then he decided to throw them in the air fryer and call it a day. The HANDMADE dumplings I spent an hour just folding. 

My issue with this is less on the dumplings themselves, but the lack of care for something I spent hours making not even considering to talk to me about how to properly cook them.

1jfkzje,I (20F) discovered that my boyfriend’s (22M) long-term girl friend (22F) made him a sentimental playlist. What now?,"My boyfriend (22M) and I (20F) met in November and have been together for about three months.  


Keeping things as real as possible: I'm overly insecure, jealous, and a terrible overthinker. First it was the girls he hangs around with at university, then I worried about the girls he was involved with at a party before even meeting me, and now it’s his long-term girl friend. I’m aware these are issues rooted in my insecurity and I’m actively trying to work on them. I’ve been able to briefly talk it through with my boyfriend, and whilst he’s always tried to be patient and understanding with me, I’m worried it’ll soon start wearing him down if I don’t get a hold of myself. He has expressed that my jealousy doesn’t necessarily bother him, but that to a certain extent, he thinks of it as childish.   


Regarding his long-term girl friend, I’ve never outwardly expressed my concerns. I don’t want to forbid him from having genuine and meaningful friendships with members of the preferred sex, and I don’t think he should change his behavior in order to deal with my irrational fears. They grew up together and have been close friends since way before I came into the picture. That being said, and as shameful as it is to admit, I’ve pieced everything together through obsessive social media stalking and the bits of information he has given me about their friendship. I haven’t even met her.  


I first started worrying when I noticed the amount of texts (mostly reels) she sends him when I spend the night. It’s not like he’s constantly glued to his phone when he’s with me either, just takes the time to respond before sleep or after waking up. Normal people behavior, I know. That still didn’t stop me from looking up her Instagram as soon as I came home, and regrettably, the stalking really became a habit there. I noticed some time after that she made a second Instagram account with only 4 followers, my boyfriend being one of them. I got the impression that they’re way closer than my boyfriend lets on, but never found the right moment to really ask about their dynamic as I want to avoid causing a scene. So, I continued stalking, and ended up on the girl’s Spotify profile where I found a 116-song playlist that has my boyfriend’s nickname in the title. Many of the songs are sentimental; one of them is literally titled “I Love You”. The first songs were added in December, around the time we really started hitting it off, up until 3 days ago. My boyfriend doesn’t even use Spotify - I make him playlists on YouTube instead if I want to share music with him - so I’m not sure if he knows about it. It’s been making me feel really off, but I don’t know how to bring it up, because it does implicate (correctly so) that I’ve stalked and pieced together stuff. But it’s still one thing that he knows about my insecurity issues in abstractum, and another one that he knows about my insecurities regarding this girl in particular. How can I approach this conversation with my boyfriend, if at all?  


TL;DR: I (20F) have been struggling with jealousy in my 3-month relationship with my boyfriend (22M). His long-term female friend frequently texts him, made a private Instagram where he’s one of four followers, and has a 116-song playlist with his nickname in the title, full of sentimental songs. I found this through obsessive social media stalking and now don’t know how to handle my feelings about it. How can I navigate this situation in a healthy way?

1jfkz7z,"my girlfriend's mental health problems have significantly affected mine, and it's unbearable. I don't wanna break but I also don't know what to do. What would u recomend in our situation? (F21, F26)","My girlfriend has BPD, and at the beginning of our relationship, things were very up and down—she would break up with me and then immediately want to get back together during an episode. Despite that, I stayed because she’s an incredibly loving and compassionate person, and I know she doesn't mean it when she's having an episode. 

The challenge is that when she’s going through a depressive episode, she becomes very distant and says things like our relationship won’t work or that the future we talked about together wasn’t real. It’s difficult because I still see her, but she doesn’t feel like the same person in those moments.

Over the past year, things seemed to improve, and I started feeling hopeful about the future. But now, she’s having another depressive episode and is going back to a mental hospital (this happened multiple times last year). I’ve always been supportive, but I’ve been feeling completely drained—isolated, unable to eat, sleep, or even function at work.

I want to be there for her, but this is really taking a toll on me. I don’t know how to handle this situation in a way that prioritizes both her well-being and my own.  What do you think is the best solution here?

1jfkvvl,"Wife (31F) can’t regulate on her own, wakes me (33F) up after only 2 hours of sleep regularly. How can I cope?","My wife has always shown this lack of ability to regulate. It’s an issue during waking hours as well but it’s worse when I’ve not gotten adequate sleep to deal with her behaviors. I have issues regulating my sleep if it gets out of whack and wife tends to seem to have more issues when I am having a bad time with my sleep cycle. 

She’ll come wake me, I’ll let her know I can’t help her at that time, she’ll get angry and start yelling or screaming, rocking back and forth hard on the bed with me trying to sleep still, start hitting or biting herself while saying how she’s going to 💀 herself because she “has no one and no one cares”. Eventually I get angry because my boundary about my sleep is being violated for the 36485392957th time and yell at her that I feel like I’m a caregiver and might as well just give into her demands so she’ll stop acting out. 

This has been an issue since we were engaged. At that point I was used to just not caring about myself so I would ignore the fact that she would violate my boundaries repeatedly. 

I’m aware my reaction is over the top and hurtful toward my wife and I feel horrible about it. I don’t feel in control in that moment. Does anybody have any advice to deal with this situation?

What about the way I feel? If you continue to agree with them then they’re going to continue to think it’s ok and that’s not fair because time after time I have to rebuild & try to prove to them that I’ve changed & that’s not who I am anymore just so I don’t have to make him choose between us. I would never let anyone talk bad or even try to say something I feel is disrespectful! My personality is a bit controlling in some situations but I have put in the work this past year to change who & let me tell you any woman who has a so called “controlling situation” is because a man made us that way with their words/actions so yes I am human and the controlling part of me comes back but then I put myself back in check because I know that if I don’t he will probably leave! The thing that upsets me is that I clearly see that he will always put them as a priority but what about me?

1jfktlh,How can I 25M learn to accept my girlfriend’s 25F usage of hard drugs?,"Well hello Reddit, I’m a long time user and listener and thought maybe you lovely people could way in on my sucky situation, and throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I 25M and Jessica 25F have been dating for around 9 months, it’s been amazing, and I love her! I moved in with her and her mom 65F at the beginning of the year and I don’t think I’ve felt more safe and loved then I have sense my early childhood. Usually me and Jessica are great with communication, I’m on the spectrum and sometimes I can’t communicate my feelings and she has been incredibly understanding and supportive, when we first met she told me her and her family were like hippys, and I thought that was cool weed shrooms acid whatever, she also mentioned she’s used other drugs during her wild years out of high school, and I thought ok it’s in the past whatever, well maybe 2 months into our relationship her brother 38M asks me “so you ever done coke before?” And I said “hmm..let’s see..nope” and didn’t think anything of it. Not long after that I saw a strange little mirror with Handles in the hall way, I was told by girlfriend that was for drugs and I thought ok sure. A few months later me and my girlfriend were talking about a this multi day hippy festival her and her family always gos to, somehow it came up that her and her family and friends would be using coke during the event. I think I had a panic attack and shut down i had a really hard time understanding why. I worked through it. Me and Jessica have had a few conversations about it, but we haven’t come up the an answer yet. On occasion the topic of doing coke is brought up by a family member or friend and for some reason it’s set my anxiety off, all my worries come rushing back, I think I’m scared of the thought of seeing Jessica use it. It makes me sick, it makes me want to run. I think it’s a trigger to my past trauma with my mom. 

context 
When I was 18 me and my mom lost our home and she had to work a second job at a bar chan restaurant, she met people there, she would spend hours and hours with them after or before work. And when she did come home she refused to be near me because she was to doped up to act normal. I don’t know what she was using, all I know is it started the downward spiral that ended her life.


Like I said me and Jessica are usually good with communication. But when the subject gets brought up I get extremely anxious and shut down until I can put my feeling into words. And Jessica doesn’t really say much, she can’t describe the reason or feeling she enjoys the drug. she has said she won’t stop using it but has promised to not use or be near me when doing. But all that does is make me paranoid and more worried. With the amount of anxiety the subject brings me I’m worried it’s a dealbreaker. It really sucks because I love this girl and I think I’d be happy spending the rest of my life with her, I love her family, I love living with them. This is the most stable my life has been since I was really little and the most loved I’ve felt sense my mom was alive. 

Ps sorry for grammar mistakes or rambling I blame the tism

1jfkoth,My girlfriend (29F) will love me (32M) if I meet her condition,"I’ve been with my girlfriend for seven years, and we’ve been living together for almost five. We decided to move in together because she wanted to stop enabling her family, as the situation had become toxic. Her family consists of seven people, her parents, four siblings, and herself (she is the eldest).

When I first met her, she was financially supporting her entire family because her parents had been unemployed for over a decade. All of her salary went to them, leaving her unable to save anything. Before we officially started dating, I asked her parents for permission to court her, and they agreed. I courted her for a year before we became a couple.

During that time, my girlfriend wanted me to get close to her family. I did my best, but they were very demanding, expecting me to buy her parents liquor and food whenever I visited, let them use my car, and more. At first, I tolerated it, but once we officially became a couple, things escalated. They were angry that my girlfriend was wasting money by going out with me. Her father even insulted me in front of their friends, saying I wasn’t capable of supporting her because my salary was too low and my job wasn’t good enough (for context, I work in IT and earn above the average salary). He also told me I was ugly, something no one had ever said to me before.

Eventually, my girlfriend realized how toxic her family was. Since she was close to my family, she saw what healthy parental responsibilities looked like. Unlike her parents, mine never expected financial support from me. Meanwhile, her parents wanted her to build them a house and insisted we shouldn’t settle down until all her younger siblings had graduated college, expecting her to cover their expenses.

One day, she confronted her parents, suggesting they should try to work since they were still in their early 40s and healthy. They got angry and refused to listen. Months later, during a family gathering, I personally asked her father if my girlfriend and I could move in together. He shouted at me in front of everyone, belittling me and saying hurtful things. After years of enduring his insults, I finally stood up for myself and asked, ""Why are you making your daughter pay for your debts? Is that her responsibility?”. He walked out after. 

Later that day, my girlfriend told me her father had slapped her. She considered calling the police but ultimately decided to pack her things and move in with me instead. After that, her father threatened to kill me and told my mother the same thing. We remained calm and chose to rent a place together.

He continued sending me long, threatening messages, and the whole experience left me deeply traumatized and depressed. Now, my girlfriend wants to reconnect with her family because she misses them and hopes to restore their relationship. However, I still haven’t healed from everything they’ve done to me. She told me that unless I accept her family again, despite my unresolved pain she won’t be able to love me fully. I can't forgive right now.

This is the best I can do to summarize our story, but there are many other bad experiences I’ve had with her family.

I love her and want to marry her, but I don’t know how to move forward in this situation.",2025-03-20 09:08:50,relationship_advice
1jfknax,"I (24M) am starting to grow an unhealthy amount of hatred and envy towards my best friend (24M), could anyone give some advice on how to steer myself through this?","I've been best buds with the guy since we were 15. We've laughed with each other, been there for each other, listened and cared for one another. You know, standard BFF stuff.

Around the middle of last year, I have been growing what I feel is an unhealthy amount of negative emotions towards the guy due to the difference in how our two lives have gone. Hatred, resentment, envy etc. At first, I thought it was simply my mental state acting up again but no, it's genuinely an internal bottle slowly being filled and I really do not want it to... do anything really. I want it empty.

Due to various life circumstances, I was only able to get my bearings straight and put my foot on the ground around the middle of last year. To keep it short and succinct, as I don’t want this to be a pity party, things just kept getting in the way of me taking my first step anywhere. Roadblock after roadblock, from being inundated with another illness to my father contracting Tuberculosis as a immune-compromised individual and developing complications that puts our family right in the path of a shotgun of all sorts of troubles, from financial to emotional. 

Suffice to say, it’s been an incredibly frustrating period.

Meanwhile, my friend.... he doesn’t have everything. He has his own share of troubles, from monetary, to ADHD and even an aging mother. But it feels like the universe keeps handing him a helping hand while simultaneously shoving a stick up my ass.

It’s always been that way since I first met him. **These are just examples of his astounding luck, please feel free to skip.**

* He graduated high school, and needed a car. He was still discovering his identity then, so he identified as gay. He was worrying about where to source the car and whatnot... until his neighbor hears his complaints and offers him his brand new Toyota truck as long as he attends 3 church sessions to “steer him on the right path”. That truck is still going strong to this day. I hope that example paints a picture as to how LUCKY my friend is.
* A diehard christian mother, who literally did not get the Covid vax, turned a blind eye and still loved him throughout his long term relationship with a boy. Even going so far as to welcoming his now ex to their christian home.
* Every time he complains about being lonely and wanting love, someone inevitably pops up that would love him to the ends of the earth. He’s always been the one to break it off, never the other way around. To which, he got into a relationship with someone in our friend group who we both knew was emotionally volatile, and upon breaking up with him was venting to me about how it was unfair and BS that the guy wanted to distance himself from the friend group.... and after my intervention.

I shit you not this was probably the one instance I’ve ever seen where the “let’s just be friends” break up text actually succeeded, even after he was being petty and went all nuclear throughout the break up.

* His mother had to move out to a different state to take care of her newborn niece and nephews, and in that new area, with a highest educational qualification of a high school graduate with a history of dropping out of 2 colleges, his brother in law hooks him up with a high paying intermediary job while he found a job he liked, as his BIL is literally one of the higher ups in the company.

To which;

* He landed a very high paying job as a lab tech that deals with chemicals and metals, with no qualifications whatsoever simply because the hiring manager liked his attitude. Which gave him the opportunity to study while working to get a bachelors in the field, which would have given him another path forward if not for his insistence to make his animation passion work.

I hope those examples paints a picture as to how LUCKY my friend is. A little long, I’m sorry. I just wanted to paint the picture clearly for all of you. That’s not even everything lol, but I digress.

Now here’s the catch, ALL of that, did not cause me a single ounce of negative emotions towards him. I was happy for him, proud for him, and celebrated with him every step of the way.

What made these emotions start to manifest is the way he vents about his life to me. Recently, he’s been dealing with a break up, thus feeling lonely. He however, caught feelings with another friend in our friend group but knew he needed time. So he vents to me his emotions, which I’ve always been fine with until now.

It genuinely irritated me seeing him go on and on about how life was unfair, how he was currently in mental ruination. Getting frustrated at things he could have prevented, like a PC he bought to play a new video game that came in faulty when I literally advised him to do it earlier. Venting to me about feeling alone, and how his relationships haven’t worked out beforehand.

I could feel my patience growing thin, like a wick burning it’s last embers. I told him that I needed some alone time for the rest of the week, as I had been dealing with health problems and my father going blind from TB complications, and him saying “*These past two weeks got hands fr fr, like all around for everyone* lol”nearly sent me into a fit of rage.

I was dealing with my father going blind, the sole breadwinner in our family as I am inundated by another bout of sickness, a friend of hours was recovering from an operation to remove a benign tumor from her abdomen, another friend was dealing with a complicated family situation while living in a 3^(rd) world country and my best friend..... was feeling lonely and insecure about his romantic situation and was struggling with giving himself proper time as a single person. 

Those are the major ""hands"" everyone has been dealing with.

**AND I KNOW**. I know that no one’s feelings is invalid. Everyone deserves to feel depressed about something, frustrated at what life throws at them and angry when something doesn’t go their way. Which is why I want advice on how to deal with this growing negative sentiment I have for my best friend.

I don’t want this to bottle up and overflow. Please, does anyone have any advice for me? A similar circumstance maybe? I don't want to start hating him. Thanks in advance.",2025-03-20 09:05:28,relationship_advice
1jfkiyb,How do I (F18) trust my boyfriend (M18) again after he admitted to watching porn during our relationship?,"To start off, I do not use reddit often, so please let me know if anything is wrong with this entry. My (F18) and boyfriend (M18) and I have been dating for just over a year. He is my best friend, and really the only one I have. We were each other’s first everything. Not sure if this will be important or not. A couple of days ago, curiosity got the best of me and I found links in his instagram link history leading to an OF page. (only fans). He told me in the beginning of our relationship that he originally had a porn addiction, in which he told me was the duration of covid. He told me since then he had stopped, however, I needed to be assured it wouldn’t occur in our relationship. I confronted him with a screenshot of the link, he put a ‘?’ and all i had to say was “onlyfans”. he replied apologizing in a short sentence. A good note is that he hasn’t ever been the greatest at handling confrontation well. I simply asked him if he had been watching porn in the duration of us being together. He said yes. He told me it was about once every two weeks. It wasn’t often that we didn’t have intercourse. He told me the reason that he did it was because he had the urge, especially if he and I went about 5-7 days with no action. He also told me that it wasn’t due to attraction to these women, and instead it was more of getting a visual to get off. at first, I was just sad. Unfortunately, it turned into anger and confusion. I was asking question after question. He is the type who needs time to really think. I will admit, things got pretty ugly over the phone. I was so distraught and upset, knowing he promised me he wouldn’t do such. the next day he came over and we had a long talk. I told him I forgive him but im just not really sure. I love him a lot and he knows so, I gave him my body, soul, secrets. I just feel our perception of love are different in certain ways, but I am willing to fight anything for he and i. I’m unsure of what to do. losing him is terrifying to me, and I want to trust him again more than anything. I also had talked to my parents about it. They said it was normal (which I don’t agree with, especially considering he KNEW it was wrong the entire time it was happening) and that he was a teenage boy and that he didn’t actually cheat on me but it really feels like he did, even though it wasn’t physical. masturbating looking at other women. I don’t know if this ideology makes me insecure. He came up with a resolution of being abstinent for a while, which I’m more than okay with if he genuinely thinks it will actually help. He has told me repetitively that it won’t happen again, and that this was a huge wake up call and that he really wants to fight for our relationship. I really want to trust his words, but him lying about the promise destroyed my trust and is really holding me back. I want nothing more than to help trust him again. Any advice, honesty, or questions will be so so appreciated. ",2025-03-20 08:55:48,relationship_advice
1jfkbt5,I (22M) found him (25M) asking random girls for nudes and potentially sexting them.,"22F with 25M. Typo in title. 
We've been together for over 5 years now. Mostly long distance. I recently found that he has been asking random girls on here for nudes and potentially sexting them. He has been commenting on those
'rate my t***' type of posts as well and asking them to dm him.
I am aware that he has always had a problem with looking at sexually explicit content of other women. He had been following Instagram nude models as well but stopped when I asked him to. 

So at this point I thought we were past this.
Not sure how to approach this.

Apart from all this, he has always been a very supportive and loving partner, always taking care of me and obsessing over me and my body as well. So this just came as a shock because I thought he was past this. I don’t know how to begin approaching this. I also don’t know if this constitutes micro cheating or is it full on cheating. How do I make him realise this is not okay? I don’t even know if he will admit to it. 

TL;DR: bf has been asking random girls for nudes and potentially sexting with them. Not sure how to bring it up so he’d actually confess to it. ",2025-03-20 08:40:08,relationship_advice

His exact words are, “I love you, but I don’t like that you are bigger than me and I’m struggling to be attracted to you.” he is around 160 and I’m at 180 right now. We are both 5’7. I know I got chubby and need to lose weight and I will start working on that,

He told me he still loves me and will help me change. But now the problem is that I don’t even want to be normal affectionate self with him anymore because all I can think about are his words. He doesn’t want to break up but my confidence is shot and I don’t even know how I can be normal with him now while I work on myself… I just want to isolate… and I cannot stop crying.

1jfk1mn,I (28F) not sure if I should continue dating my (30M) boyfriend who suddenly doesn’t find me attractive,"
Well I am not sure where to begin, so I guess I’ll do out of my chest thing…
I met an amazing guy and fell in love. I’m 28F and he’s 30M. We met 1.5 years ago and this is my longest relationship so far. When we met, I told him that I have a timeline that I prefer to follow, and I did let him know that by a 2 year mark I would like to know if he would like to proceed to the next step and get engaged. I’m a very straightforward person, the religion/culture is not part of the timeline decision. We are both non religious and come from the similar background. He understood and accepted my timeline. 
The relationship is amazing and we moved in fairly quickly (6 months in). No surprises after moving in. Our values and interests seem to be aligned. We both have great careers, no life or family drama, no depression, etc. 
Closer to 1.5 year mark I started bringing up the engagement. Casual conversations that he entertained to a certain degree. I was definitely more excited about it. All my previous relationships ended by choice, mainly I didn’t see a future with other guys, and I never let them know what my timeline is (I’m adding this part to make sure people don’t assume that I push marriage onto everyone I date). My boyfriend was the first guy I introduced to my family and they love him. 
He decided to gift me a piece of jewelry for my upcoming birthday (a necklace or a bracelet). We thought that it will be nice to go to jewelry stores to look at some pieces. I asked if he wants to look at some rings while we’re there to get an idea of how much engagement rings cost, and what styles I like (we already talked about engagement rings and he entertained the idea of looking). Again, I seemed to be more excited about the whole process. Tonight we had a sudden conversation about the possibility of extending my dating deadline. I asked if he has any concerns and he let me know if he’s not sure that he’s ready to commit to me for a lifetime. That is understandable and we both discussed it and it was very calm. I asked what thoughts does he have about it, and he said that about 2 months ago he started thinking about it more. He said he’s 50-50 on his decision and he is just not sure. I tried asking for reasons and his doubts and nothing concrete came up. One thing that he mentioned was the physical attraction. We haven’t changed visibly since we started dating. We are both pretty good looking people, but not in our best shape. We haven’t gained or lost any weight since we started dating, so our physical shape stayed the same. 

Here I have to mention that we haven’t had sex in a while, and I have brushed it off to a low libido on his end. We had conversations about it and every time he said that he is tired (he is in the beginning of his career and he works long hours). I am pretty tired as well by the end of the day and don’t feel like harassing him for sex. 
I love him for whom he is and in a way I was ok with waiting for him to gain back the energy and excitement for the bedroom. Life happens and some people would describe it as dead bedroom. Yes I was bothered by it, but not to the point of ending the otherwise great relationship. 
During the conversation tonight he said that lack of sex comes from the lack of physical attraction (that was the first time he mentioned it). It was a bit shocking since I asked quite often what was the reason and every time he said he was tired. 
I feel very confused at this point. I don’t want to held him hostage in this relationship and he says he doesn’t want to break up. I told him he needs to think about what he wants and let me know because I don’t want to spend the rest of my life in a sexless marriage with a person who doesn’t find me attractive. 
At least two or his previous partners have cheated on him and I never understood why. I don’t cheat and I don’t want to. I wonder if the lack of sex is a repetitive problem because now the stories start making more sense. I am also not sure how to address his uncertainty of getting engaged. It’s a sensitive topic and I don’t feel like pushing it further. 
If any of you have been in a similar situation, I would greatly appreciate your advice?",2025-03-20 08:17:02,relationship_advice
1jfjz6y,Update - My husband (32M) revealed to me (30F) that he may want to have children someday…,"Hi I’m back! A lot of you commented on my post so I figured I owed everyone an update. TLDR at bottom if you don’t want to read through whole recap of our follow up.

So it was a couple days after the first post that I was finally able to sit him down for a follow up conversation. I really appreciate everyone who gave me advice going into this, it really helped me figure out the direction I wanted to go in.

We had just had our morning coffees, mood was good so I asked him if he was in a headspace for a big conversation. Of course he essentially said “well now you’ve got to tell me anyways otherwise I’ll wonder”. 

I told him I wanted to talk more about his stance on children and if that is something he feels he needs, and I want to make sure we’re still on the same page.

You guys, the way he looked at me so shocked and asked “where is this coming from”? Like we hadn’t just had a HUGE convo about birth control a couple days prior. I was stunned 😅

I explained that his reasoning, not the fact that he didn’t want to get the vasectomy, made me nervous that he does want to have kids someday. I told him the phrase “always envisioned myself having kids” is what really got to me and made me the most anxious.

He grabbed my hand and immediately apologized for the way he said that. He explained that yes he always thought that maybe he would have a kid or 2 growing up, but that isn’t his dream in life per se. He also explained that the world is not one he would currently even want to raise a child in.

Well I followed that up if with hypothetically all the conditions were right (world gets better, our finances are better, ect) if he thought that would increase from “would be nice” to “I’ve got to have it”? Also took this moment to reiterate that I am not having children, so if he thinks that it’s something he *actually* wants, we need to have a bigger discussion.

He took a moment to think, and told me he didn’t ever think he would need to have children. He does still maintain that it’s a nice idea, but that it’s really nothing more than a nice a thought. 
He also said he would not want to raise a family with anyone but me, so if we’re not having kids then he’s not having kids. 

I guess a lot of you in the comments called it. He’s fine not having kids, I panicked and didn’t ask him to elaborate. However he does agree that choice of words did make it seem like he could have changed his mind.

Soooo we’re fine, everything’s fine 🤗. We do still need to figure out a new birth control and whatnot (thank you to everyone who threw in some more suggestions for both me and hubs to look into) but I am just so glad that my wonderful husband is still on the same page with me.

TLDR - The way my husband reacted to the mention of a vasectomy freaked me out because I don’t want to have kids. We had a follow up convo and we are still on the same page about not having kids. Whew!",2025-03-20 08:11:24,relationship_advice
1jfjz4o,How do I (30F) move forward after (36M) husband lied to me?,"My husband and I have been together 12 years and I would've said we had a very solid, strong relationship with good communication that we have built over the years. 

However, my husband lied to me twice, the first time was a mistake and he was worried to come forward (he did eventually come to me and we spoke about it, admittedly I shouldve been more understanding but I was upset). 

The second time he made a choice to lie again, and repeatedly lied to me. I only found out after I confronted him, which he kept denying until I provided all the evidence and he eventually gave in. 

The lies involve boundaries we set, it's not relating to cheating / affairs. I however have a complex history involving child abuse / domestic violence and it is incredibly difficult for me to trust. So I am really stuck on how to move forward. 

How do I move forward with trusting him again? Especially after he kept denying when I confronted him with evidence, that hurt a lot.

1jfjytg,Really need an advice ‘28F’30M’,"
Well I am not sure where to begin, so I guess I’ll do out of my chest thing…
I met an amazing guy and fell in love. I’m 28F and he’s 30M. We met 1.5 years ago and this is my longest relationship so far. When we met, I told him that I have a timeline that I prefer to follow, and I did let him know that by a 2 year mark I would like to know if he would like to proceed to the next step and get engaged. I’m a very straightforward person, the religion/culture is not part of the timeline decision. We are both non religious and come from the similar background. He understood and accepted my timeline. 
The relationship is amazing and we moved in fairly quickly (6 months in). No surprises after moving in. Our values and interests seem to be aligned. We both have great careers, no life or family drama, no depression, etc. 
Closer to 1.5 year mark I started bringing up the engagement. Casual conversations that he entertained to a certain degree. I was definitely more excited about it. All my previous relationships ended by choice, mainly I didn’t see a future with other guys, and I never let them know what my timeline is (I’m adding this part to make sure people don’t assume that I push marriage onto everyone I date). My boyfriend was the first guy I introduced to my family and they love him. 
He decided to gift me a piece of jewelry for my upcoming birthday (a necklace or a bracelet). We thought that it will be nice to go to jewelry stores to look at some pieces. I asked if he wants to look at some rings while we’re there to get an idea of how much engagement rings cost, and what styles I like (we already talked about engagement rings and he entertained the idea of looking). Again, I seemed to be more excited about the whole process. Tonight we had a sudden conversation about the possibility of extending my dating deadline. I asked if he has any concerns and he let me know if he’s not sure that he’s ready to commit to me for a lifetime. That is understandable and we both discussed it and it was very calm. I asked what thoughts does he have about it, and he said that about 2 months ago he started thinking about it more. He said he’s 50-50 on his decision and he is just not sure. I tried asking for reasons and his doubts and nothing concrete came up. One thing that he mentioned was the physical attraction. We haven’t changed visibly since we started dating. We are both pretty good looking people, but not in our best shape. We haven’t gained or lost any weight since we started dating, so our physical shape stayed the same. 

Here I have to mention that we haven’t had sex in a while, and I have brushed it off to a low libido on his end. We had conversations about it and every time he said that he is tired (he is in the beginning of his career and he works long hours). I am pretty tired as well by the end of the day and don’t feel like harassing him for sex. 
I love him for whom he is and in a way I was ok with waiting for him to gain back the energy and excitement for the bedroom. Life happens and some people would describe it as dead bedroom. Yes I was bothered by it, but not to the point of ending the otherwise great relationship. 
During the conversation tonight he said that lack of sex comes from the lack of physical attraction (that was the first time he mentioned it). It was a bit shocking since I asked quite often what was the reason and every time he said he was tired. 
I feel very confused at this point. I don’t want to held him hostage in this relationship and he says he doesn’t want to break up. I told him he needs to think about what he wants and let me know because I don’t want to spend the rest of my life in a sexless marriage with a person who doesn’t find me attractive. 
At least two or his previous partners have cheated on him and I never understood why. I don’t cheat and I don’t want to. I wonder if the lack of sex is a repetitive problem because now the stories start making more sense. I am also not sure how to address his uncertainty of getting engaged. It’s a sensitive topic and I don’t feel like pushing it further. 
If any of you have been in a similar situation, I would greatly appreciate your advice?",2025-03-20 08:10:32,relationship_advice
1jfjyod,Intimacy anxiety (F30 and M30),"I (F 30s) have been with my husband (M 30s) for about 10 years now. We have had many ups and downs, largely due to his drinking. For the past 2 years he has stopped drinking, we went to therapy and it's like having my partner back. We have had many deep hard conversations and his honesty and openness has made me fall for him harder than ever, and I can honestly say he is the love of my life. An absolute gem. 

The problem I face is that I really struggle to initiate intimacy. I become so anxious and overwhelmed. He has a fetish where he likes to dress like a girl and be submissive. I am all for this, I love when he dresses up, I can be very assertive when the mood takes me. The thing is the mood doesn't always take me.

I struggle immensely with being dominant, especially to a man. Sometimes I get swept up in the moment, but a lot of the time I will plan something I really want to do, then sort of...panic? The idea of starting it fills me with anxiety and dread, definitely no sexy feelings. If I think about my idea without and expectations, it's fine, I get excited and really want to try it, then when it comes to doing it, I panic and shy away. 

Has anyone else struggled with something similar? How do you get over this? It's ruining our sex life and I want to be able to implement these plans, not just for my husband but for me, I want to do them. It's so frustrating and confusing!",2025-03-20 08:10:13,relationship_advice
1jfjxw3,Leave my daughter’s father? 25f 27m,"I feel like this post would be waaayyyy too long if I described everything. But to make a long story short: I believe I should leave my daughters father, but I don’t want to only because we would then go back to joint custody and physically not seeing her for 3-4 days a week will kill me inside and out. I work overnight and would live by myself if he loved out. I can’t imagine living without her. She is my everything, the literal breath I breathe. She is 5 years old and I had her at 19. We were both very young when I had her and we hadn’t even been together that long. Over the years we basically have been through so much bs together. Cheating, lying, insane crazy fights, you name it. And I don’t want to paint this picture as him being the only villain bc I want to take accountability for myself and my actions as well. I lied and cheated as well in the beginning. I have no excuses for what I did. I was young, had no idea how to be in a relationship, I had insane mental health issues, insecurity issues, daddy issues. And this isn’t me making excuses, I had a bunch of issues I should’ve dealt with before getting into a relationship so I could’ve been mature enough to stay in one and respect my partner. But I am not the only one at fault. He likes to claim that he never did anything when I know now all the years later, when we were trying to work things out and he’s always attacking me , he was doing the exact same shit I did. We would always be in weird spaces where we weren’t together but sort of but not really bc “I needed to get my shit together”, yet he was out he doing bs lol. Regardless we both had no respect for each other and did each other dirty. But for almost 2 years now we decided to get back together and come other to be mature and work on our relationship and be faithful and honest and respectful bc we loved each other and wanted to be a happy family for our child. Honestly, I think that was just bs and we thought we loved each other bc we have a kid together. Since we have gotten back together he has moved in spends all his time with us. So we even live together now. But all this time I know he has been unfaithful. In march-April of 2024 I went thru his phone and found that he talks to a bunch of girls, grannies from them, and not jsut gets nude from them, BUY NUDES FROM MAD GIRLS LMAOO, and is always talking to girls on snap and ig. He eventually found out I knew and I confronted him and he turned it on me saying I was the reason he was doing what he did. Partially bc of me cheating on him in the past, partially bc I hadn’t shaved in a while so he was like yea I’m unattracted to you, and then bc we had money issues where I wasn’t being responsible with money. He can totally be upset about me being irresponsible with money and we can fight and argue and try to get through that, but cheating and talking to other girls? I don’t think that’s the answer. So I we did fight about that and he admitted it was wrong and said he would stop. I know he was lying bc I personally don’t think he genuinely cares about how I feel emotionally when it comes to our relationship bc I cheated in the past. But so did he. He cheated on me right before I moved into my apartment a few times and admitted it like a year later. So in his mind he’s allowed to do whatever he wants, and he still does. Months later I have gone back into his phone and it’s the same. Idk if he’s had sex with anyone bc I haven’t been able to look that long when I have but for over a year, on mondays he would be alone and have the house to himself bc I would be at work and our daughter  would be so to her grandmother. Pretty sure he has cheated on me. And with the amount of women in his phone and girls he talks to that are in the area I’m sure he has. 
But moral of the story, he thinks bc I did what I did he can go and do whatever he wants. And that’s fine if he wants to fuck a bunch of people. Im to the point where i dont even care and i dont have any feelings left, which makes me wonder if we ever had them or we just thought we were in love bc of our daughter. I do have a lot of love for him but we are insanely different. He had literal anger issues. I don’t think he properly knows how to love or be affectionate. I don’t even see him be affectionate with our daughter, ever. We have gotten into insane fights where he has told me he hopes I die and he wants me to kill myself and get run over by a truck. He has told me he can find a new mother who’s a way badder bitch and way better mom for our child. He said I have nothing good about me other than my looks. Mind you I’m very smart, work in pharma, have a great paying job in leadership. I may have made mistakes when I was young and dumb but I have been turned a new leaf and have been trying to show him. Yet he has gotten worse and worse. And even when I bite the bullet and say you know what it’s bc of what I did in the past. We will get better, he gets worse and I can never be myself. I’m always stepping on eggshells. I feel like I can’t be me, I can’t express how I feel ever. If I feel any differently than him about anything, I’m wrong and he’s right and I’m stupid. Then when I confront him on how he makes me feel, again it’s bc I’m too sensitive and I need to snap back into reality. When I’m around him I feel empty and even more alone than when I’m actually alone. I really don’t see why we are even together. I don’t even think he likes me. I guess now by reading all of this, I know my answer. I just don’t want to leave my daughter. ",2025-03-20 08:08:22,relationship_advice
1jfjrge,My (ftm23) gf (f23) won't be intimate with me in any way. How do I handle this?,"Lately my gf has been depressed. All she does is go to work, come home, lay in bed, and crochet. I like that crocheting at least makes her happy but that's all that seems to interest her nowadays. I just got out of a deep depression so I understand the struggle. At first I tried getting her to go on walks with me to get out the house but she was unreceptive to that. I figured this is something she'll have to work through herself so I'll just stay to the side cheering her on. It's been tough though. She doesn't wanna have sex when she used to crave it everyday. She doesn't wanna kiss which bums me out but im a grown man so I can handle it. She doesn't wanna even hug me half the time. It's like I have to remind her I need affection. She'll make an attempt sometimes but i can tell she's not into it so I just stop. I'm afraid I'm being too needy but idk.

I want to be a good boyfriend but idk what to do and it's getting to a point I'm forgetting why I loved her in the first place.

She told me everything was over with her ex that I know personally and I believe her. But yesterday while scrolling in her gallery i discovered hundreds of nudes and even sextapes with her and her ex. She hasn't told me anything about this although I didn't ask but why would she keep all of this ? I don't know if this is a common thing. I got nauseous watching them first because he has a bigger than mine and 2nd because i saw her having fun with someone else. Btw the last nude he sent her was 2 months before we got together...

1jfjph3,I (25F) think I’m starting to like my future flatmate (30M),"This is my first time posting here. I’m not a big Reddit person but I think maybe strangers on the internet may give me some advice on this situation. Sorry if the text looks weird I’m posting from my phone.

So I met this dude about a year ago in a relationship app. When we first met I wasn’t even sure he wanted to go out with me because he is kinda hard to read and later on I discovered he is neurodivergent and so am I so idk I kinda suck at social skills and I think he’s harder to read than neurotypical people. I think we had like 2 dates, and I had a crush on him, but he started saying he didn’t want to be in a relationship because of some past traumas and I kinda left it at that. He mentions it a lot. He also pulled away a little bit because of some personal issues and I let him be and we stayed just as friends.

Then, his problems got worse and he got problems with his living situation and he asked me if we could share the apartment I rent. I live alone and things are expensive, splitting rent and bills would really help me out so I agreed. He is trying to save money to move so he isn’t here yet. This was like 2 months ago and we got closer after this. Sometimes he stops by after his work day or after my workday and we hang out, watch silly stuff, order food and talk a lot. There were 3 days we hung out on a festival and he slept over my house all 3 days and I think that’s when I got weird about this. We have a lot in common, specially for being both neurodivergent and I like identifying with another person and he is really kind. The days of the festival, I was really tired and he gave me a leg massage so I would be so sore the next day, I cuddled him, another he took my shoes off for me because I was exhausted and my boots were really wet (and I hated that I felt gross but he insisted to help me because I was very overwhelmed with tiredness), helped me clean the house, cooked for me. He slept over other days after that as well and we always sleep in the same bed, since I currently only have one bed in the apartment, but nothing happened. Last time we hooked up was last year when we were both kinda drunk and we never really talked about it. 

I’m not sure if he’s just literally a very nice guy, and he’s trying to be a good friend or he’s into me and don’t want to push anything because we will be living together soon and he doesn’t want to make things awkward. He’s a very literal person so I’m not sure if there’s hidden intentions or feelings. But I’m crushing hard on him, maybe even a little more than a crush and I’m just confused. I get really weird around him and I can’t bring myself to do anything about this whole thing. 

I really wanted to ask how to approach this situation? I don’t think I have the guts to bluntly ask or sit to have a serious conversation about this because I’m not sure if I’m reading too much into this situation and I don’t want to make anything awkward. Is there any way I can maybe do little things to try to find out he’s feelings about this whole thing before having an actual conversation? Like, maybe ask him if he massages his friends often lol or maybe ask if he likes sleeping over to snuggle my dogs or because of my company

Idk, I feels like a teenager again and I hate liking people romantically, sorry if I’m kinda all over the place and being silly or weird about this 

And btw, it’s worth mentioning that in my culture friends have a lot of physical touch as affecting, like hugging, kissing cheeks, long touch, I spooned my best friend a lot when we lived closer and we didn’t have feelings for each other, but this massage thing was kinda too much intimacy for a friendship lol specially for neurodivergent people, I’m not comfortable being touchy with 99% of my friends and he doesn’t seem to be as well",2025-03-20 07:50:08,relationship_advice
1jfjmb0,My(37f) boyfriend (28m) is too close to roommate,"So the roommate is an older f and still attractive.   She has been going through a lot....Are the following signs of infidelity? 

She and my boyfriend say I love you to each other and she does this with others. The issue is their hugs.  She will hug him for a moment and kiss on his neck.  Several times he's had marks from her.

Once in front of me I watched him rub her back as she kissed his neck and left a visible mark.  When confronted,  he claimed she is just ""going through it"".

He had made no effort to establish boundaries with her.  Just telling me to accept it as friendship.   

Two weeks ago,  I showed up and she was either going to or coming from his room naked.  I was on the porch and saw her. She said ""this bitch "" and went into her room when she saw me. 

I want to break up with him but his way of proving his loyalty was to move in with me.  Saying if they were fucking he'd still be there. 

I'm a fool I know.  I do love him but not as much since this happened.  ",2025-03-20 07:42:54,relationship_advice
1jfjk06,My GF behavior is concerning me. Not sure how to proceed? 21M 19F,"I (21M) have been dating my GF (19F) for 1.5 years. She had 3 exes in the past. The first ex was serious ex who she dated him for a year and broke up 2 years ago. She was constantly cheated on, and the rest two was not as serious. Her past relationships were LDR, countries apart. She's had a lot of childhood trauma growing up as well.

Early in our relationship, she was impulsive—we broke up, and she did that by blocking me after arguments. She would verbally tell me we are done. She then texted her exes as she does not have any friends she can talk to. They were all blocked after when we were in contact. This happened twice. Stopped a year ago. 

She told me she realizes how impactful the behavior is and decided to work on the serious relationship together. 

Fast forward, we were doing good for about a year.

5 months ago after I broke up with her (no cheating issue. Just had trust issues), she texted her first ex after. She never talked to him before, it was different exes prior. When she did, he was flirting with her, and so was she. (She was claiming him as her ""man"", and sending Tiktok wedding videos like ""This is us after blocking each other 5939 times"").

I've had some speculation that she was not completely over that ex in the beginning of the relationship (a year ago), despite having 2 more boyfriends after that relationship. When we were dating, about 3 months in, she had an widget on her phone (which she admitted seeing everyday), with that first exe's intial along with heart. She deleted when I brought up.

It was pretty clear that her ex wanted her by the texts between them, and she was the one who mostly cut him off.

We were in no-contact for about a week. As soon as I texted her, she blocked him. This was 6 months ago. If I was a place holder, wouldn't she have not blocked him for me?

We both agreed that she has a lot of issues and traumas, so she started therapy 2 months ago.

Asked her why she texts her exes. She told me how she wasn't used to the type of relationship ""healthy"" (as in not being cheated on and being emotionally abused in a relationship) her and I had, so she went back to what she felt normal to her because being with me was such a big change to what she knew.

2 months ago (4 months after she reached out to her ex) she told me she still sees me as her ""soulmate"" and would do anything to make this relationship work.

TLDR: GF texts an ex right after break up and even flirts with them because she is lonely and doesn't want to grieve the relationship. Everyone is blocked as soon as we start talking again. Her behavior of blocking me and breaking up and texting an ex stopped over year ago, but the only time she texted her another ex was 6 months ago, when I broke up with her. She has therapist now. 

Would this be considered emotional cheating, or is this just her seeking attention?",2025-03-20 07:37:35,relationship_advice
1jfjise,Why is my(F23) boyfriend (M22) so clingy?,"Some backstory- we started dating about 3 months ago. It happened pretty fast after we met at a party and hit it off. Ever since then there are very few days we’ve spent seperately. He lives with his parents for now as hes finishing his studies, while looking for a job. I on the other hand live with roommates and am studying and working.
 He is the sweetest and most caring guy ive ever dated, takes care of meals, helps me with my tasks, even tidies my room. Every day im met with compliments and often flowers. The reason why im writing this is that im not a very clingy person, and i believe sweet things should be in moderation. I find myself repeating ushy gushy things back to him all day long, everything seems to be about our relationship. It feels like he can and will move everything around to spend every single day with me. 
I have a million projects parallel my studies and even tho he helps me with tasks, he needs an immense amount of my time and support. Ive voiced it before that - 1. I dont like constantly being told grandiose sweet things, 2. I need some days inbetween our meetings to recharge and spend time with myself and my tasks. Its driving me crazy cause i find myself resenting him a bit in moments when he tries to force new plans for the next opening of a free moment i have, or when he overstays his welcome till 11PM on a study night. I dont know what to do, cause in those moments of resentment i end up being upset about essentially good things- sweetness, closeness, the want to help.

1jfjimk,I [18M] discovered my mom [46F] is having an affair with my uncle [40sM] how do I handle this situation?,"i'm 18, and my mom is 46. we used to have a really good relationship, but one day, everything changed. she went out that day, saying it was for a hospital visit. later, she called me and asked if i wanted her to bring me any food. during that conversation, i asked where she was, and she said she was in a restaurant, waiting in line to buy me something. i said okay, and then she thought she hung up the call, but she didn’t. she forgot to.

i was still listening, and then i heard her talking to someone. i kind of recognized the voice, and then i finally confirmed that it was my uncle , my father’s younger brother. i thought, oh, they met. then my mom started making some noises i don’t even want to discuss. i was in shock, shaking, and crying when i heard it. i immediately started recording. i felt completely broken and had no idea what to do.

when she came home, i waited for my father to leave because i didn’t want to argue in front of him. he might have actually divorced her if he found out what she was doing. after he left, i made her listen to the voice recording. she acted confused, asking, “what is this?” like she had no idea. i told her, “this is your voice, you didn’t hang up, and i heard everything.”

she immediately started crying and defending herself, saying he met her at the restaurant while she was buying food and that they were just talking. i asked, “then what were those words you were saying to him?” she cried even more and kept saying she didn’t know what i was talking about, asking, “won’t you even trust your own mother?” she said things like, “what kind of son have i raised?” then she said, “okay, i won’t talk to anyone anymore since you’re doubting me. no son should ever doubt his mother like this.”

after that, things became really awkward between us. after some time, i tried to forget about it and started talking to her again. but a few months later, i found out she was calling him every day, literally every single day, and deleting the call logs. she thought i was dumb enough not to notice. i didn’t say anything because i knew she would cry again.

one thing i should mention is that my father doesn’t care about my mom or me. she’s the one who has taken care of me since childhood. she’s also very religious, which makes this even harder to believe. after praying so much to god, how could she do something like this?

one sunday, i went to my friend’s house, like i always do. after returning home, i found that my mom had locked the door. i knocked, and she spoke from behind the door, asking me to go buy salt from the store immediately. she was breathing heavily, and there was fear in her eyes. i said, “let me charge my phone first, it’s dead,” and she immediately said, “give me the phone, i’ll charge it.”

that’s when i got suspicious. i pushed the door open, and i saw someone rushing to the bedroom from the hall. i moved towards the bedroom to see who it was, but my mom ran ahead of me and shut the door before i could enter. that’s when i knew , it was my uncle. i waited in the hall in silence for a minute. then my mom came out first, looking sad.

i walked into the bedroom, but i saw no one. then i checked behind the bathroom door, and there he was. this bear-sized mf didn’t even know how to hide properly. i caught him and shouted, “who are you, and why are you here?” in a loud voice. he tried to cover my mouth with his hands, but i ran and screamed even louder.

my mom started crying. i told them both that i was going to tell my aunt (his wife) about this. my mom and my aunt are good friends. my mom immediately started crying harder, and he tried to defend himself, saying, “i just came casually to check on your mom.” bro really thought i was going to believe that bullshit.

then my mom said, “he’s drunk, that’s why he came here. i gave him water, nothing else happened, please don’t think we were doing anything wrong.” i told her to stop lying and that i was going to call my aunt. that’s when my mom started blackmailing me, saying she would kill herself if i told my aunt.

i was in complete shock. i couldn’t believe what she was saying. while we were arguing, that mf ran away. i looked at my mom and said, “how can you do this to me and my dad? are you even a mother? you’ve lost my respect. how do you expect me to see you the same way again?”

then she started making excuses, saying, “your dad never treated me well, that’s why i did this. after our marriage, i saw him (my uncle) and started liking him, and that’s how it started. please forgive me.”

i asked her, “then what about all the calls you’ve been having with him every day?” she denied it and said, “you don’t trust me.” i shouted, “trust?!?” she finally said sorry and promised she wouldn’t talk to him again.

after that, we barely spoke. she only served me food, and that was it. some days later, she told me she would die if i stopped talking to her. she said, “i love you more than anyone, son. you’re the one i care about. i can’t live without talking to you.”

slowly, i started talking to her again and tried to forget what happened. but it wasn’t easy. after that, she didn’t talk to him , at least not in front of me.

yesterday, she went to my grandmother’s house and said she wouldn’t be coming back until tomorrow. i said okay.

then, i had to attend my friend’s birthday party in a park. we moved to a plain, grassy area to cut the cake, and then i saw her. she was with him again, leaning on his shoulder and doing things i don’t even want to mention.

i was completely frozen. i was with 23 friends, in the middle of a celebration, and inside, i was dead. i didn’t know what to do. my heart felt so heavy, i wanted to cry but couldn’t.

i went home before she did. when she arrived, i asked, “why did you come today? you said you’d come tomorrow.” she said, “yeah, but i was worried about you, so i came.”

i don’t know what to do anymore. she blackmails me, then goes out with him again. it’s a cycle. i don’t know how to break it. i’m writing all this because i’m so confused. this is a really dark place she has left me in. she even promised on me, and in our family, breaking a promise like that means wishing death upon the person you swore on.

1jfjhfd,My GF (23F) doesn't find me (22NB) attractive anymore,"I was always very skinny but maybe like 2 years ago I started to gain weight. I still don't know why because I always had high metabolism. It may be because I had thyroid cancer and removed it. 
The point is my girlfriend, who is bisexual, started to lean more to liking girls (my biological gender is male). She said to me that she still loves me and feels comfy around me but she doesn't want to do anything sexual with me because I gained weight and she doesn't find me physically attractive anymore. I want to start going to the gym but I'm battling anxiety and depression. I'm also trying to find a job to earn money so I'll have enough to start going to the gym. 
I've always had low self-esteem and I see myself as someona that's ugly and I sometimes can't even look in the mirror. However my GF helped me with my self-esteem a little but now it came crashing down because she doesnt find me attractive. I just feel like shit and even uglier than before. It's not about sex, I just want to be attractive to her and myself. I know that working out is the answer to my problem, but I wanted to know if anyone had a similiar situation?

My boyfriend and I have been dating for over a year now. Like the title says I feel uncomfortable with my boyfriend watching any type of pornography, when we first started dating I thought I wouldn't mind it, but not the idea of him watching nude people makes me feel kind of uncomfortable and sad. I have no problem with him self pleasuring I mean it's something a lot do so I don't mind that. He only watches when he's home alone and we've never had intimacy issues either but it still kind of bothers me. Is this not that big of a deal.

How can i talk about this?

1jfjgr8,I (19M) am not really feeling overly happy with my relationship (2 years) (19F) anymore but nothing bad has happened?,"Me and my gf have been together for 2 years now. Nothing bad has ever happened really except maybe sometimes she can be a little controlling. She is my first gf and over the last little while, I've kinda just felt like I don't have feelings for her anymore or anything. BUT when I think about ending it, it brings me to tears because I don't think I can hurt her or the thought of not having her in my life anymore. However I think if I did end it I would have to cut her off because I would just be reminded of her too often. 

I don't really know what to do because my brain is telling me to just break up with her it might make me more happy but my heart is telling me the direct opposite. 

EDIT: I should also say my family also really likes her. The other thing I'm struggling with is she comes from a family that fights to the point where it is almost abusive but you can't really do anything about it because it's just yelling and this takes a mental toll on her. She's told me many times I'm the only thing that makes her happy most of the time.

1jfjfio,Help on how to better support my (21F) bf (22M) of one month,"Hey! So obviously we are in a very new relationship. I just want to preface that I’m absolutely obsessed with him and I’m struggling to not blurt out the L word on the daily around him. Our relationship is getting more intimate and we are slowing learning more about each other. He recently opened up to me about his childhood. To say that his dad is an awful person and he was forced to grow up fast is an understatement. My bf is nonchalant about it but obviously it scars deep, he also expressed how he hates that most of his issues come from his dad’s abuse (physical, emotional) I don’t really know how to navigate it other than I told him that I don’t view him differently and that if he ever wanted to talk I was there. Is there anyone else that has been in my shoes that can offer advice so I don’t sound like I’m parroting the most nothing statements ever? 


I just want to ease his pain and make it better for him even though I know that’s not how it works. His overall living situation and childhood was kind of shitty so he says he’s used to it. I struggle to express/explain to him how amazing and sweet and strong he is, and how I wish I could make it better because he didn’t deserve that, and he’s so dismissive of it because he doesn’t want to be pitied so I don’t want to white knight him or anything. I don’t know it’s hard to find the right step

Oftentimes when we're hanging out in my room and laying down together, I'll find myself wanting to kiss her or to like put my hand on her butt or sometimes her boob. I know that it's inappropriate but sometimes I'll think she's potentially in the mood so I make a small move thinking that we could potentially be intimate.

Even though we only have sex or be physically intimate once every month or two, I find myself desiring some sort of physical touch up to multiple times a week and I guess I feel kind of disgusted with these urges. I don't want to sexualize or objectify my girlfriend, and I feel bad that these thoughts sometimes make me think and do inappropriate things, and I would like to find some sort of way to reduce them entirely. I don't really want any sort of surgery or prescribed medication, but are there any supplements, diets, or techniques I could implement to hopefully significantly reduce my libido?

1jfj4vx,Torn Between Staying and Leaving—33M and 24F,"Hey, I’m a 33M, currently in a relationship with my 24F girlfriend. I truly love her—I’ve never had this much in common with anyone before, and I’ve never been this close to someone. It all happened so fast; she moved in with me within a week, and now, nine months in, I can’t stop thinking about being single.

Every day, I imagine my future, and no matter how hard I try, I see myself being with someone else . I feel stretched between trying to stay content and making the move to break up. In my last relationship, I had similar feelings, and when I finally ended it, I felt liberated. But this time, it feels different because of the deep connection we share.

Now, I’m questioning everything—Is this just a trauma response? Do I truly love her? Am I even attracted to her? Did we move too fast? I do want this to work, but the constant rumination never stops.

1jfj28d,I (28F) have an unrequited love to my best friend (27M),"
I (28F) will be vague in describing identifiers because for all I know, he might see this post (I doubt it, but whatever... if you see it, then you see it lol). 

I just want to post this here and let my feelings ramble before I completely let him go in entirety... also, I need to clear my mind because I need my brain at peak for my line of work. I can't do my job with him living rent free in my head.



Introduction:

I've been in love with my childhood friend (27M) for years. 

It came to the point where we've been talking and I thought we were doing so well, and it was going somewhere. 

We messaged each other daily, all day long, even though both of us are at work (i.e., we both work in very demanding fields... imagine healthcare). 

We talked about the most mundane things. What we're cooking, our pets, we're #2-ing at work. What our dreams and aspirations are, what we look for in a romantic partner. Work gossips, life gossips, friend gossips, celebrity gossips.

I really thought it was going somewhere, and I was already in love with him because... heck... he's beautiful, smart and I *know* him. From the moment I first saw him as a child, I was already infatuated with him. I was just an audience, and he was the one his class 'volunteered' to represent them in a school competition.

It was really just dumb luck that we were put on the same class a year after I first saw him. I wanted to get to know him, very badly. We became 'best-friends'. 

Now that we're older-- we flirted. He tends to be intense at times, and often shared suggestive reels or reels that mostly only couples share with other another (i.e., ""want this in the future with you""). Whenever I try to ask him what he meant by sending me those reels, he back-tracks and either un-sends the reel or say ""oops sorry wrong sent"". 

At first, I thought he implying something else but then I quickly grew to learn that he will forever deny everything. So I became very literal with him. If he doesn't say so, then I won't acknowledge it.



Dilemma:

Everything was going so well but suddenly he tells me that he met someone (aka: Bob). That Bob outright asked him to be sexual, and he found it very amusing. He entertained that person, and regularly chats with him.

I didn't realise it's been already a year and they're still regularly talking with each other. They exchange pictures and flirtations. He even had to explicitly show me a screenshot that Bob sent him an ""I love you"", and all I could ask was ""what did you say?"" as if I was a very supportive best-friend.

I could tell that he likes Bob even though he keeps avoiding to say it outright.

He's very nosy about my love life (or lack thereof). That, according to him, I'm too intimidating and too callous. That I should give people chances. It all started ever since he met Bob... he kept pushing me to get into a relationship... almost very desperately.

One night, I called him to say my attention was on him that's why I don't like anyone else. He was quiet for a minute then laughed, and said that he has to end the call because he's picking up Bob. I took that as a clear rejection (for the second time!! I already told him that I had a crush on him when I was a kid).




Additional Information:

The more I talk to my friend, the more I discover (and he also speaks about it sometimes), that he has a low self-esteem. He doesn't believe in long-distance relationships, and that labels give him anxiety because of the 'expectations' it comes with. 

He also said that, he doesn't want to 'entrap' the other person if ever he's in a relationship. So that the other person can fully be sexually active with someone else other than him and it wouldn't count as cheating. I thought it was either his low self-esteem talking, or he's projecting because that's something he might do. He also believes that he'd rather not put a label on relationships so it will hurt less if it does end up not working out.

Anyway, I realised that I can't stay as his 'best friend'. I have also acknowledge that we are not going to work out, especially with his viewpoints in relationships as restrictive... and taking away his freedom.

I've tried distancing myself, and I am flirting with someone else now... (which on he kept asking me about).

No matter how much I don't respond to him, he always sends me a message in various social medias. I admit, that he is indeed my weakness... so I end up replying to his message at night after a full-day of actively ignoring him.

But I think... enough is enough. I am really, genuinely very happy for him if he finds love with Bob... but I can't be with him as his 'best friend' in the future. 

I want and need a peaceful life. I'm the opposite of him... I thrive in having a clear set defined roles.

We both have a history of getting ghosted by a close friend, and I absolutely don't want to hurt him by disappearing on him without saying anything like how that friend did.

I also plan to get rid of the one and only necklace that he gifted me, because I want to start anew with no sentimental things. My friend suggests that I break it with a hammer before tossing it into a lake or river or wherever.




Question:

TLDR; Now, I just don't know how to properly tell him why exactly I want to break off of our friendship. There's two ways I can think of right now:

1. Tell him it's because I thought staying as his friend was okay even though I have unrequited feelings for him... but now I really don't think it's healthy for me nor will help me move on. 

2. Be vague... on to what extent though?



Essentially, I don't want my final message to sound like an ultimatum. I don't want him to stay with me just because I said I want to break off our friendship, and I don't want to stay with him forever stuck in an undefined limbo.

I just want to say that I want to completely end our friendship because it's mentally taking a toll on me. This is the only factor I want to be selfish on.",2025-03-20 06:59:42,relationship_advice
1jfj1dh,Family drama is tearing up 21M relationship with my girlfriend 19F-need advice on this?,"We got caught up in family drama and it is a shitshow.

For a little bit of background I’ll start by saying that my family consists of my parents me and my elder brother.
Her family consists of she,parents her younger and elder sister.
Her elder sister who is of same age of me was in a relationship with my brother (23) 5,6 years back.
My parents and her parents work in italy.They are kinda close and often go out together on weekends or get together.

I’m 21 about go graduate and my gf is 19 right now and both of us knew each other long ago but we got into a relationship 1 and a half years ago.
Personally we got no issues when it comes to us and both of us love each other so much.
In comes our family,since we all are coming from same place both our families know all the negatives and kozhapangal of each family.
My family is also kinda shokam and her too.


Also my  parents disapprove things her mom says mostly like boasting and stuff and i am not saying my parents are always in the right.my parents always share these things and everything with us and this caused me to have some discomfort with her mom witch i have never said to her until her mom made some comments on my college to some other guys degrading my college.I confronted my gf about it and she told me she doesn’t believe it.


Since our family is close,they hanged out here too.
In comes her elder sisters who just got out of a relationship lasting 4 years and the breakup was messy.
Suddenly her mom told my parents about setting up my brother and her elder sister.since all of them were fond of each other they got together until last week  her sister said she is no longer interested.Since family is deep involved in this 
Her dad called my dad and said it which i think is completely valid.But my dad at that moment was
Drunk and got very sad and got angry.He told her dad it was okay but please tell before hand if my gf is planning the same cause it would hurt him a lot .

He lastly crashed out and said some hurtful things to them.
Which he often uses when he is mad .
The next morning  my gf called me and said my dad told her parents that my dad and mom are not interested in my gf and my dad needs an answer from my gf the next day itself.

I asked my dad and my brother vouched since he was there listening to the call that he never said that although he admitted he said the crashout part.
I told her this and she told me she trust her mom and doesn’t trust my parents or brother.

We have already discussed about the family issues we had and we have to face them.she then asked me can i give her any guarantees that there wont be another incident like that.
I told her that i cannot guarantee such a thing .
I asked her again to say what to do,she followed up and said “ninte decision enthano ath nee edutho”
I told her we are too young to be involved in this shitshow and we should breakup.But i really donot know what to do

She is still a first year and we been in a ldr for the entire relationship due to circumstances and her college.she told me she donot trust any of my parents or my brother

Idk what i should do
Please give some advice  on my situation
I really love her but i really wish her family wasn’t involved.

1jfj14j,My (F28) husband (M26) complains about using condoms and now I have ‘the ick’. How do I get past this?,"My husband and I have been together 7 years (married for 3). Our sex life has been decent. It’s had its ups and downs but generally we have a great time together. 
So last year, I had gotten my IUD out with the intention of starting a family. Due to many circumstances (job changes, mental health, finances and the like) that goal was put on a bit of a back burner, with multiple conversations with my husband about why and a general idea of when I’d feel comfortable for us to reassess. 
In that time, intimacy had definitely been scarce. When we started being intimate again, I told him we needed condoms as I was not up for putting IUD back (and wasn’t sure what BC I’d even want to try) at this time. We got them, no issue. Before we even started using them, anytime sex was brought up, comments including phrases like “you’re making me use condoms” and a very clear dislike of the idea under the guise of joking. And every time, I’d remind him Its not really funny and I’m not “making” him do anything. 
So the time finally came and we’re having a good time (foreplay). He sticks it in (I’m not facing him at this point) and it doesn’t FEEL like he has one on so I flat out ask. He says no, but he will go grab one in a sec and says he won’t come in me. I promptly remind him precum can have viable sperm and can cause pregnancy (though unlikely). So he goes to get one and we continue.
The next time we’re in the middle of doing it (probably a little over a week later)he suggests anal; which I like but he’s not a fan of. I can count the number of times on 1 hand that we have done anal in the 7 years we have been together. He follows this prompt up with the notion of not using a condom if we do anal instead. I tell him I’m not really in the mood for that today, and we carry on. I officially have ‘the ick’. He doesn’t feel like a safe place anymore (sexually). I don’t feel as comfortable as I once did. This feels like a relationship-breaking issue. Even if not immediately but in the long run. Could some kind of counseling or therapy fix this? ",2025-03-20 06:57:13,relationship_advice
1jfivd7,"My girlfriend (24F) cheated on me, and now she says she needs space. I (24M) don’t know what to do.","My girlfriend (24F) and I (24M) have been together for eight years. We’ve had a lot of ups and downs, but we always found a way to stay together. I love her deeply, and I know she loves me too, but recently, things took a turn that I never expected.

My Mistakes and Hers

I won’t deny that I have made mistakes in our relationship. For almost five years, I had a bad habit of texting other girls—not emotional affairs, not physical cheating, just texting. It was immature and disrespectful, and I deeply regret it. But every time she caught me, I apologized, she forgave me, and we continued. I never forced her to stay. In fact, at times, I told her she deserved someone better. But she always chose to hold on, saying that I made her happy despite my mistakes.

However, she also texted another guy she met at the clubs / bars during those years. I never brought it up or argued about it because I trusted her, and I believed it wasn’t serious. I never used it against her in our fights.

I also had moments where I was emotionally distant. There were times when I would say things like “maybe we should break up” out of frustration, but I never truly meant it. I never left. I always came back to her, and we kept working on things.

She Cheated, and Everything Changed

Recently, I promised her that I would change for real—no more texting other girls, no more emotional distance. I told her I wanted to take our relationship seriously, and we even planned a trip to Japan for pre-wedding photos. She was thrilled… or so I thought.

Shortly after, I found out that she had gone on two dates with another guy. They held hands, hugged—things I had never done with another girl. When I confronted her, she broke down in guilt, saying she regretted it and wanted to stop seeing him. But then she asked me if she could go on one last date with him for “closure.”

That completely shattered me. I didn’t want to be controlling, so I told her: “If you’re curious about him, go. Find out if you get butterflies from him that you don’t get from me.” But I didn’t mean it—I said it out of pain. At first, she refused, but later that night, she asked again, saying “I just want to end things nicely.”

I was furious. I had just promised to change for her, and now she was asking me to watch her go on another date? But I felt like I had no choice, so I let her go.

Aftermath: She Became Distant and Prioritized Herself

After that second date, something changed. She became distant. She told me she had realized her “self-worth” and was “tired of always fixing things.” She started bringing up my past mistakes constantly, saying, “Now you know how it feels.” It felt like she was guilt-tripping me—as if her cheating was justified because I had hurt her before.

She told me she needed space and time to focus on herself. She said she had been “selfless for too long” and had “lost herself” in the relationship. She wanted to start prioritizing her own happiness.

Meanwhile, I was pouring my heart out trying to prove to her that I had changed, that I would do anything to make this relationship work. I asked for some boundaries to rebuild trust—like not going to bars for a while and sharing her location temporarily, since we used to do that in the early years of our relationship. But she refused. She told me, “You won’t believe me wherever I go anyway.”

It’s been two weeks since she cheated, and she’s already talking about going out to drink again. When I told her I was still scared and struggling to trust her, she said, “Ahh, you still can’t get over it?” That completely stunned me.

Where Do We Go From Here?

I feel completely lost. I know I hurt her in the past, and maybe she finally snapped because of it. But I don’t understand how she went from wanting to fix things to making it seem like I’m the one who has to prove everything now—even after she cheated.

She tells me she still loves me and wants to fix things, but only after she takes a break for herself. Meanwhile, I’m here, feeling like I’m waiting for someone who isn’t waiting for me.



I want to believe we can rebuild trust.

Is it too late for us? Or is there still a way to fix this?",2025-03-20 06:44:50,relationship_advice
1jfiokv,not sure if i’m (21F) in love w my boyfriend (22M) of a year,"
my boyfriend (22M) and i (21F) have been together for a little over a year. we’ve been long distance because of college for most of it and were medium distance for a few months over the summer. i want to start by saying, he’s a rly great guy who buys me flowers and generous gifts and is patient and funny and i feel very lucky that he treats me so well. i get along well with his family and friends and we share similar goals for the future. in many ways he’s my best friend and i’ve never felt more comfortable w someone. however, this being my first serious relationship and him being many of my firsts, i’ve been unsure since the beginning. sometimes it’s intrusive thoughts but other doubts come up naturally both when we’re apart and together, though more frequently when apart. i can’t tell if im in love with him the way im supposed to be. he always says i love you first and when i say it back i feel like im lying. i love him dearly, but i don’t now if im in love with him. the sex is pretty good as far as i can tell, but ive wanted it less as time has gone on. even since the beginning sometimes i just don’t want to kiss him. i’ll admit he’s not my ideal type physically and it makes me feel shallow to say, but im just not attracted to him the way i want to be attracted to my future husband and that makes me question our future together. that’s not to say i don’t ever find him attractive or want to kiss him or be intimate - just not as much as i think should. am i caught up on some fairytale idea of love that doesn’t exist? everyone tells me “you just know” but i don’t.

I don’t know if I should stay with him, I’m starting to regain my confidence after being completely consumed with insecurities for so long. At the beginning of the relationship he was clearly watching girls online a lot and after asking him to stop he keep doing it. It took years of me crying and my self esteem lowering to have him finally stop. Now he’s sick of my insecurities and can’t stand that they’ve gotten worse since we started dating. When he’s angry he  tells me that I’m so annoying, he doesn’t care about how I feel, that my triggers don’t matter to him because he doesn’t have them himself. & that he shouldn’t have to change himself to make me more comfortable, that should be my job. There’s been many moments like this and because it always starts from me being insecure, it’s my fault in his eyes. This all rly hurt and I’m always kind when I ask for reassurance from him, sometimes he’s nice but other times he’s scary. I feel like couples shouldn’t act like this but idk. My friend thinks he’s abusive and that I should leave him.

1jfinik,18M with 18F How to stop watching porn?,"I’m at my first year of university, and essentially have met a truly amazing girl who is now my girlfriend and who is also my first person I’ve had an intimate relationship with. Recently she discovered porn on my phone, I thought nothing of it because for me it has been the norm almost like YouTube or Netflix since I was 13 to pass the time when I’m bored just to watch porn. (I understand this is a very unhealthy way of thinking, but porn has really messed with me). I assumed very ignorantly that nothing was wrong with it, I didn’t often watch it, very few now that I had met her, in fact the time that she caught me was the first time I had in a few months as she had been away. She sends me pictures to try and help me, but I feel like I’m so far gone I need extra stimulation - extra excitement when I get off. Which is also very unhealthy and I understand that. Of course, when she found out she was distraught, I was shocked but when she was upset it felt like the most obvious thing in the world that porn would upset her. It makes her feel unattractive and not good enough and I understand now. We had a chat about it, not a good enough one but a chat, she is hesitant to talk about topics that hold a lot of weight which can be difficult sometimes. A decent bit was left unsaid, but all in all she was still hurting clearly. After the talk, I tried my very best to keep away from porn, I was very good, but when she went away I struggled. Im ashamed to say that I sexted strangers on Reddit to get off. This was the second time I did this, the first time I didn’t tell her about which I know is awful. Another time I tried sexting an ai chatbot to try and skate around the “rules” of cheating. I’m just really not a good person.

I just, when I look at myself in life, I’m a good nice person, I know nobody will know me and you’re going to assume this is just filler plot to defend myself but there you go. I feel like I’m a good person, I’m well-liked, get along with essentially everyone, this feels so out of character for me. I think honestly because I don’t feel like my actions are wrong at the time or I don’t see the consequences instantly or at all, then I pretend like they don’t exist. It’s a bit ridiculous that I can claim to be a saint when really I’m just an awful person cheating behind my girlfriend’s back. She is my world and I don’t know why I do it, she deserves so much better than me, I love her so much and I’m ashamed.

I understand the right thing to do is to tell her, but I know it will destroy her and she will most likely leave me. Maybe I’m not a strong enough of a man to tell her. I just love her too much to upset her, but I understand why she deserves to know.

I just hate myself, but in the moment all I care about is finishing. It’s like I’m a different person and I hate it, I hate everything about it. I just wish I could be loyal and switch off my porn addiction, it’s causing me to lie to my girlfriend but I’m really in trouble either way.

It’s just tough, and I wish I hadn’t done it. I guess advice is probably beyond this post, thanks for reading it if you did. I’d like to hear your thoughts if you have any.

Thanks

1jfimjp,Husband 47 m wants me 43 f to terminate pregnancy. What would you do?,"We have 4 children and thought it was a good number to end on... but I mentioned a few times that it would be nice to have maybe one more. He said he was done having kids.  
We had unprotected sex one time and I got pregnant (had no idea what was going on with my cycle since I had just stopped breastfeeding a week prior). I was afraid to tell him because I didn't think he would be happy— he immediately said we can't, you've gotta do something. I asked him if we could take some time to think about it. Now I'm 6 weeks and physically cannot terminate- the emotional pain, the wondering and what ifs/ could have beens would be too much. He's saying he is not willing to have a 5th child, already feels stretched, and basically said he would likely be leaving by the end of the weekend. His reasoning is that l'm making unilateral decisions in our marriage. I shared that we both decided to have sex and that his pushing me to terminate feels like a unilateral decision as well. I feel so conflicted here, like there's really no winning, except children are amazing miracles and he or she would be one more layer of love in our family. If my husband leaves, what will that look like for our kids and me? We have the resources to take care of them well, pay for college, travel, childcare, etc. Am I being selfish for wanting to keep this baby? What would you do?

1jfil3a,Is my (24f) boyfriends (25m) mom controlling?,"My boyfriend is an only child and his mom occasionally shows, strong signs of being a stereotypical “obsessed boy, mom”. He is her only child. She was also a child, prodigy, so she had extremely high and somewhat unrealistic expectations of him pretty much his entire childhood both with his education and being an athlete. He loves his mom doing much, but they do have a strange relationship. me and his mom do not have a good relationship at all. We have been together for over five years and his mother still does not like me primarily because I am not black. when she says that she has nothing against me and doesn’t dislike me. She said she has no issue with my color, but it has been very apparent from the start of us dating that she does not like me and the only reason she’s ever given when angry is that I am white. He went out bowling with friends tonight and she text me at 12:30 in the morning asking if I knew where he was. Thinking she was just being a worried mom. I told her he went bowling with friends and his phone is dead but she was OK. She said have him call me. I told her I would have him call her first thing in the morning. She really responded. I will be up all night. Surely he’s gonna come home at some point.” Followed by “surely someone has a phone charger.” I’m not sure if I’m just being overtired and over emotional or if this is weird. In my opinion, he is a grown man and can call her in the morning like I said. I find it weird. If she’s worried, she should just say please have him text me when he’s home safe. Instead she’s demanding he call her even if it is 3 AM on a Wednesday night. During Christmas of this year, he told his mom he would not be going to the Christmas for the first time to go to my families. Again we have been together for over five years. Her first response was “no you’re not, you’re going “ She was very angry and petty about i’m not going for weeks. I feel like her behavior is controlling and weird for his age, especially considering the fact that he is completely financially independent. He doesn’t get any help from his mom in anyway. I don’t want to bring this up to him and possibly turn into an argument though if this is just in my head and I’m over thinking. I don’t think I am, but please let me know if you guys think her behavior is controlling and I should say some thing.",2025-03-20 06:23:20,relationship_advice
1jfikq9,I (35M) have been seeing this girl (30F) for about a month and honestly I’m not feeling it?,"We met on a dating app a month ago, and so far we’ve been on four dates. She’s honestly an amazing person and I really want to be in a relationship with her, but I haven’t really developed the feelings inside that says “I want to be in a relationship”. I’ve been respectful, we’ve always hugged after each date (I never kissed her). She’d always send me good morning texts and pictures of her cute cat which would make me smile. The problem is, a month in I don’t think I want to be in a relationship with her. We come from two different worlds first off. She is a really sweet person and incredibly kind, even says she got me something for whenever we go out next (which I feel guilty about). I don’t want to lead her on, and I certainly haven’t taken those next steps. She talks about these vacations and trips she wants to do with me, and I can tell she’s fallen hard for me.

I 21F and my fiancé 23M live together and just moved into a house (rented) in a new town, i’ve never lived in this town because i’ve always lived in our states city but he’s lived in multiple other states/towns. Today i was back in the city finishing the cleaning from our move out of our old apartment. After i was done after a while he called me asking if i had let his dog out of the basement. i said no and he proceeded to tell me about how his dog got out and my puppy (a little over 3 months old) and him got into a garage bag and trashed the living room with it. she ate some garbage and had diarrhea on the floor in places and such. he said that she started snarling at him by the front door and she ended up biting him, something she’s NEVER done before. she bit him so hard he bled on both the door and the floor. he told me he had smacked her when it happened which i wasn’t happy about but i understood. well it’s been multiple hours later now back at the house and i woke up and ran down the hall because i heard her yelping. i found her hiding behind the toilet and him crouching in front of it. he wasn’t touching her but she was crying so bad..this is a behavior im very certain she picked up from his adult dog who does the same when he knows he’s in trouble. i came into the bathroom and calmed her and he left. when she was finally calm i took her back into the living room where he was laying on the floor. while talking about what had just happened i noticed that her eye is very blood filled/red. i teared up and showed him and he said that it’s from when he smacked her when she bit him. he said that he smacked her about a foot away into the wall that she was disoriented for a minute. i simply nodded and have taken her to nap with me in our bed. he just came in to kiss my head and kiss her which she loves but she wouldn’t even look at him. i feel like maybe im over reacting but i can’t tell. i don’t believe in hitting animals almost at all but he’s used to raising big farm like dogs and having chickens and stuff so he believes differently i just feel so frozen right now. my puppy has a drs appointment tomorrow and i will have them look at her eye but i just need some outside thoughts on how to talk about and handle this. we’ve been together for almost a year and this is the first time this has ever happened, yes i know we got engaged very fast. we plan on a long engagement of like 2 years, just adding that because i know it’ll be questioned. what’s a good way to talk about my feelings regarding his reaction?",2025-03-20 06:15:46,relationship_advice
1jfigwa,I’ve (28M) forgotten what makes a date (27F) good. How can I show effort?,"It’s been about 5 years since my last relationship. For about a year or 2 after that, I frequently went on dates with other women but nothing ever panned out. Eventually the dates went from trying to meet someone to just hooking up once or twice before someone else came along or they ghosted me. After a year of that, I sorta just gave up on meeting anyone in general.

A few weeks ago, after a couple of years of being off dating apps, I matched with someone. She’s very kind. I can see that she’s making an effort to get to know me. The conversations flow nicely and for the first time in a good while, I find myself wanting to meet someone and genuinely hoping a relationship can maybe form.

I finally felt comfortable enough to ask her if she’d like to go out on a date sometime. She agreed and we’re planning on meeting Friday.

The thing is, I’ve sorta forgotten how to actually plan out a date or how to prepare for a date. Back when I actually knew how to talk to people, I’d usually just go for a coffee date or lunch at the park. This was back when I was like 21 so I’m not sure if that’d be enticing for adults in their late 20’s.

Overall, I’m super excited to meet her and I’m hopeful that she’ll like me enough to at least agree to a 2nd date, but I don’t even know how to date anymore.

1jfif0c,My ( 31 F) boyfriend (35 M) left my messages on read and ignored me for hours while I was at the hospital with my mom.,"My bf and I have been together for about 6 months. Prior to that we’ve been on and off for the past 4 years due to various relationship issues. One morning we were talking normally back and forth through iMessage. Later that morning I had to rush to the hospital in an ambulance with my mom because she suddenly got very ill. While i was at the hospital a lovey dovey message popped up from him in my notifications so i quickly messaged him back to let him know i was at the hospital with my mom who was very ill. About a half hour later when i didn’t hear back from him I opened my messages to see that he had just read my message. At the time i figured he was too busy to reply so I waited for his response. I heard nothing back for the next hour and a half at which point I messaged him to ask what he was doing. He tells me hes very busy helping his family out with something. When i didnt respond back to his message, about an hour and a half following that, he asks me what Im doing, to which I say I already told you what Im doing. By this point I was feeling miserable at the hospital having waited literal hours at the emergency room and taking care of my mom who was getting worse so I sent him another message letting him know i feel like crying. He then responds back to me acting all confused and asking me what happened but by then i was busy and couldnt respond. My mom ended up getting admitted to the hospital and I came back home later that evening to have dinner and rest for a bit before going back to the hospital. During this time he calls me acting all confused and asking me what happened. I tell him what happened but i break down crying and telling him how miserable i felt especially after he ignored my messages. At this point he reassures me he didnt see my messages because he was busy doing other things. Al though I believed him at the time that it was an honest mistake, something felt off to me. The next day he came to pick me up from the hospital and he admitted right away as soon as i got in the car that he initially thought i was lying about the whole situation of her being in the hospital and felt extremely horrible about it. As i hadn’t slept in the past 24 hours I was already feeling exhausted and hearing from him that he thought initially that I lied about my mom made me break down again. He again promised me that he hadn’t seen my original message but thought i was lying about the whole situation when I had spoken to him on the phone. The reasoning he gave me for acting the way he did is because he claims I’ve made up lies in the past to get his attention so he thought i was being like the boy who cried wolf. But here is the thing, i have never in my life made up such a lie about myself or a family member being ill or at the hospital. There have been however times where we were having a fight or an argument when I was upset at him for ignoring my messages or calls where I’ve said stuff like “what would happen if i was at the hospital i cant even rely on you”. I feel like he’s completely taken those past situations out of context and is using that to justify thinking i was lying. He has apologized to me about the whole situation and he says he feels bad about it but wants me to forget about it and move on. He also keeps using that same reasoning to justify his actions that day. But something is not sitting right with me and I feel like I cant just get past something like this. Am i making this situation a bigger deal than it needs to be? Im worried this could be a red flag  for how he may treat me in the future.",2025-03-20 06:10:59,relationship_advice
1jfid0m,I (22f) went on a dinner date with an older guy and he gave me $300 for hanging out with him. My boyfriend (22m) thinks I sold myself for money. How can I get him to understand that I didn’t sell myself? And would this type of event be acceptable or appropriate when in a relationship?,Last night I was invited out to eat by a regular customer of my local club. Who has been going there for about 5 years. I had met him on Saturday and his regular dancer did not want him to get a dance with me. Even though I had gotten his attention by my long hair and outfit. As well as looks in general and he approached me. She was still against it and jealous. But in the time frame I had spoken to him he knew that I had only made $25. He also knew that I had been struggling in general with recent events such as being in the hospital. So his regular said it was okay for him to reach out to me. He invited to take me out for dinner and to help with some money since he knew I was having a hard time. We went to hooters to eat I choose there. And when it came time to leave he handed me $300. My boyfriend thinks that there’s no way customers just give dancers money and help them without something extra happening. He said maybe at the club but not on a personal date. He also said that it doesn’t seem appropriate to go on a date when in a relationship. But I didn’t have to do anything he just got to know me and asked me about myself.

1jfid0f,Am I (21F) overacting after finding out my boyfriend (21M) has been stalking girl’s social media?,"So my boyfriend (21M) and I (21F) have been dating for 1.5 years, and I feel like overall have a good relationship. At one point he wouldn’t listen if I told him to not do something (ex. I asked him to not aggressively shake his face really close to mine (think of a member of KISS). Eventually I kind of told him that I’m done with telling him to respect my boundaries when I ask him not to do something so I think he’s figured that he’s on his last straw. He actually did start listening to me and we haven’t really had any issues since, except for when I found out he liked these bikini pictures of these 2 random girls that live in our city. I asked him to unfollow them and he did. I was pretty disappointed in him because he knows I’ve been cheated on in past relationships and have some trust issues when it comes to social media. I don’t think he would/ I’m not really worried about him physically cheating on me, it’s mostly just the emotional cheating that I’m worried about. About a week ago he went away with his family for a few days and I kept overthinking that he was doing something but, I kind of just blamed it on period hormones and didn’t bring anything up. He got back on Tuesday and then on Wednesday when we were watching a show before I went to work, he fell asleep on me. Curiosity and overthinking got the best of me and I decided to go through his phone. I didn’t find any messages, likes, comments or whatever to or from other girls. However, when I went to his link history, it was filled with random girl’s VSCO accounts of girls he doesn’t follow. They were all dated from when he went on his trip and even the day we hung out. I feel betrayed almost and a little heartbroken because why is he looking at all these girls VSCO accounts. Some he even went back to a few days later. It doesn’t make sense to me and it’s such a grey area that I almost wish he actually cheated on me. It’s just so weird because I can’t shake this feeling and I want to know if it’s worth bringing up or not. I kind of planned to just tell a story about how my coworker found out her boyfriend was stalking girls pages and ask what his thoughts are about the situation. I usually tell him Reddit stories I see so it wouldn’t be out of the ordinary for me. I just don’t know what to do so any advice would be appreciated. ",2025-03-20 06:06:51,relationship_advice

i’m done with the mind games and deception, and now i want to plan a breakup that hits him where it hurts—emotionally, mentally, the whole package—while still keeping my dignity intact. i need to leave in a way that forces him to face the reality of his actions and completely question his worth, and i want to walk away looking like the one who was wronged, not the vindictive ex.

1jficqq,Am I (23F) or is my boyfriend (22M) selfish?,"

I’m writing this honestly to just conceptualize my thoughts, but I would love advice as well. For some background knowledge, I am 23 years old and I’ve been dating my boyfriend(22) for 5 years now. August of 2024 we both moved across the US for me to complete a premed program.
Let me break down my issues into parts. 

Before we moved away, I made all the money. I worked full time while completing my undergraduate degree. I lived with my boyfriend for about 3 years at his parent’s house. During this time, he did not work. About a year before we moved, he got a part time job only bringing home about $150 a week. At this time I did not mind, since I enjoyed my job. However, moving away would require him to work full time since I will be doing everything possible to get ready for med school. I grew up very poor so I try and be as careful as possible with bills and spending. I budget, but all the money is in his account. I got a part time job while being here, but only bring him about $400 a week. He got a full-time stocking job working at a department store, but was very unreliable with attendance. He started to dislike his job so I heavily pushed for him to look for a new job BUT keep his job until he has something lined up. However, he quit one day, with nothing lined up and rent due in about 2 weeks with $5 in our bank account. He did not talk to me before he did it, he just called me and told me he was coming home early. 


My boyfriend is a selfish lover. As childish as I may sound, he gets all the cuddles, rubs, scratches, etc. I don’t even remember the last time I was held. In addition he NEVER goes down on me. I mentioned to him numerous times that that’s what I like, but he didn’t listen. He hasn’t gone down on me in about 3 years no matter how much I asked. Eventually I gave up. However, because of this, our sex is awful (at least to me). I don’t feel any connection, I feel forced to please him and make him happy but sometimes it just feels like a chore. So to me now, sex is just an activity I do to get him off and make him happy.He does not have a clue about how I feel about this because I really don’t want to hurt his feelings. The times I’ve mentioned I’m unhappy in the bedroom it was out of anger, and came out completely wrong . Because of this, I have a hard time actually talking about it to him. Even so, can you create chemistry and passion with just a conversation? 

Let me preface by saying I absolutely love this man with my whole entire heart. I could not picture myself leaving him nor do I plan to. He’s my best friend and I don’t think I could handle breaking it off. But, no matter how many times I bring up my concerns to him he does not listen. Maybe I’m a little egocentric in thinking I deserve EVERYTHING I’m asking for, but I do believe I should get more than I’m getting. The issues I feel we have he may not even know about. I do give him snippets of how I feel but he either is clueless or chooses not to listen. I would love honest advice and comments. Tell me I’m being selfish, slightly narcissistic and childish if that’s what I’m being. Or if this does seem like an issue on his part let me know. ",2025-03-20 06:06:18,relationship_advice
1jfibhx,FWB situation but I’m confused 21F and 21M,"Hey! So I (21F) have a current “fwb” situation with a guy (21M) that I was super close with in highschool. We almost dated in highschool but unfortunately I chose to be with another asshole over him (my bad). After this we had a huge falling out, he wanted nothing to do with me and he disappeared (switched schools). 

About a year ago he requested and messaged me stating how he had seen me out in Public a few months back and hadn’t been able to get me, my laugh and smile out of his head but was debating that whole time if he should reach out as he wasn’t sure if I hated him. In fact, I missed him and told him that (but it was more friendly). Then we made plans to meet up and talk out our shit. Turns out we don’t even live 5 minutes from eachother so we ended up taking on a walk that night, talked for hours, worked through everything and even laughed about it. Eventually we both came to the conclusion that we both weren’t ready for a relationship so I kind of stopped communicating. 

Shortly after that - he witnessed my mom hitting me in front of my house to which I took my dog and left for a huge walk with tears running down my face. There’s a bench/sitting area by a ravine which is where he was when he saw the “beating”. I naturally walk that way and he practically waited for me. Gave me a huge, tight hug and held me. He let me talk about what happened and made me feel better. Towards the end he kissed me and said I was the prettiest crier he’d ever seen. Since then I emphasized that I missed being friends- he agreed and then somehow we started this fwb situation. Outside of the sex I treat him like a friend. But recently he’s shifted. He calls me gorgeous,beautiful, expresses when he misses and wants to see me, he’s even reverted back to the nickname he had for me from highschool. We started watching a show together and sometimes he asks if he can spend his whole day off with me, if I mention meal planning or cooking he ALWAYS wants to be in the kitchen with me and asks me to help him learn to cook. He makes jokes about weather or not he should be jealous or another guy. We haven’t seen eachother or talked much the last couple weeks because he’s been really busy with renovating his house in between work and school so what he’s started to do is send me “updates” or where he is, what he’s doing. That kind of thing. 

This has never happened to me before so my question is… is it safe to say he may have feelings for me???? Or can guys act like this while maintaining a FWB situation and not have feelings??? 

PS- Everyone’s perspective is welcome but I’d prefer men’s perspectives ",2025-03-20 06:03:42,relationship_advice
1jfibgs,I (M24) have a problem with my girlfriend's (F24) male friend.,"So let me start like this, I met my girlfriend 2 years ago. I deeply love her and she deeply loves me. So let me say this, her male friend has been around since the beginning but he had a girlfriend at first. They never really hung out or talked, I didn't have a problem with it at first. He seemed cool and I don't think she'd ever do anything to hurt me at all. But soon, it all began to change, about 2 months in, him and his girlfriend broke up, soon things got weird. So, about 4 months after him and his girlfriend break up, he buys MY girlfriend a snake. I wasn't mad at the time, it just seemed..strange. I love my friends to death, I do, not enough to drop 3k on them on a random Monday because they made a passing mention of wanting a snake. But, I held my tongue. I trust my girlfriend after all. Then, on his birthday, MY girlfriend made a post about his birthday about how he was ""the best person"" and how she appreciated how he ""spent all his time with her"". Which was quite hilarious to me as we lived together. But yet, I held my tongue again. Soon, he took her to get food for said snake and she came back with a full set of nails done. This time, I didn't hold my tongue. I told my girlfriend to quit being around him. She wasn't angry she was more frustrated with me I assume. She didn't do anything with him for a while until her birthday. When he bought her a 400 dollar vanity and then 800 dollar concert tickets. I properly lost my shit at this point.y girlfriend said it sucks because she doesn't want to make me upset but he's her only friend. I'm sorry to sound cynical but I've heard this before. The only reason I came here is because she's never really given me a reason to not trust her. I just need to know, I guess, Why? Why not just say no? ",2025-03-20 06:03:38,relationship_advice

1jfi9aw,Why Does a (M28) My (F27) Girlfriend Act Distant After Hyping Up Our Reunions?,"I’ve been in a relationship for six years, and there’s a recurring issue I can’t seem to get past. Whenever we’re apart—whether it’s for work travel or other reasons—my girlfriend hypes up our reunion, talking about how much she misses me and how excited she is to see me. But every time we actually reunite, it’s a completely different story.

Instead of warmth or excitement, she’s distant, moody, and awkward. Today, for example, we didn’t even touch—no hug, no kiss. She eventually went to another room to be alone. It’s happened so many times that I can’t even remember a single occasion where she was truly happy to see me after a flight, except for one time—and even that didn’t last.

That one time, I had just arrived back and met up with a group of friends, including her. It was a big group, and as I was greeting people, shaking hands, and catching up, she was shouting my name in an exaggerated, playful way. I didn’t register it right away because I was overwhelmed by the crowd, but when I finally noticed, I greeted her and hugged her. Instead of being happy, she got upset, saying I embarrassed her, and then withdrew emotionally for the rest of the night.

This whole pattern really bothers me. It feels like emotional whiplash—anticipation, followed by coldness. I can’t tell if I’m being overly sensitive or if this is a form of emotional manipulation. Has anyone else experienced something like this in a relationship? How did you handle it?",2025-03-20 05:59:34,relationship_advice

Anyways after the baby we still had sex but lately for the past 4 months we haven’t. I am a very romantic guy so I try to do everything to make her feel special and loved. I buy her flowers every Friday, also take her on dates, and of course am a very active father. I ask about her day and talk to her/reinsure her a lot, etc. 
but whenever I try to initiate anything she says “she’s not in the mood” which i respect and say “that’s okay maybe next time” and just go in the bathroom and finish myself off even if I’m not satisfied I don’t want to bug or nag her. Last week I tried but she ended up being on her cycle so i respected that of course. Her period only lasts for 4 days as she told me so on Monday night I tried after we put our daughter to bed, I tried to do things she liked like kiss on her and talk dirty to her. 
I know she’s not a sex doll and has feelings so I make it as loving as possible. Anyway she gave in that night but when I put myself inside her she was dry.. I asked if I did something wrong and she just told me to continue so I did. It took 2 hours to even get her a little wet and she wasn’t even moaning or anything..it felt like I was assaulting her so i stopped. Once again I asked her what’s wrong and she said nothing..I told her we don’t have to do it and not to force herself to please me…she said okay and went to bed. I once again went inside the bathroom that night. And Wednesday I saw her phone, she’s never had a password on it so I could just open it..I did and snuck around..I know I was wrong for invading her privacy but I just needed a hint or something..she only has 2 friends and I saw in their group chat that the last time we had sex which was months ago she had to take a viagra, I felt hurt and humiliated that I couldn’t even turn my wife on..I learned that it can take a year of more for a women to feel like themselves again after giving birth..before our daughter we’d do it Atleast 5 times a day which was amazing and sometimes I’d have to tell her I can’t keep up..but now it’s like her sex drive completely disappeared. Even while she was pregnant we did it a lot. Is there anyway I can fix this or bring it up without sounding like I’m just looking at her for sex? but what I want is physical intimacy with her. I want to make her feel desirable and pretty but I don’t want her to force herself to do it because she feels like she has too. ",2025-03-20 05:55:41,relationship_advice
1jfi7dm,my boyfriend M21 had a dream about another girl (im a 18F). what does this mean?,"Hi for context, me and my boyfriend have been together for around four months now. This is my first ever relationship (first ever ANYTHING with someone). he's been in a couple relationships in the past before, whereas im entirely new in dating/relationships. he recently told me he had a dream about a girl (he didnt specify any specific person so ig it was just a random girl) and she was trying to ride him and moaning really loudly (fully clothed) LOL (laughing thru the pain hehahah). anyway, i get that dreams arent actually real and ive done some research that basically indicates this is a deeper rooted problem having to do with issues in our relationship. it doesnt necessarily mean its gonna end the relationship or  that he wants someone else (or so ive read). we both talked about it and i think the issue has to do with our sexual experiences together. ive never had sex before him, as i said he was my first everything. to be honest, whenever we have sex, im just there... i dont really react, dont do anything, i dont moan, and it lowkey doesn't really feel like anything when we do it. i dont think its his issue, but my own i can never get out of my head and i think im just insecure about the whole act itself. im insecure about how i look during it, what im doing, and im too scared to try new things with him to make it more pleasurable for myself... ive tried to do things by myself to figure out what i like but i still cant seem to get it tbh. like i think i can go my entire life without having sex... idk if im asexual or not? idk. but i talked to him about all of this and he said he wants to work things out with me and he doesnt care how long it takes for me to figure this stuff out about myself; im willing to have sex if it makes him feel good, even if i dont want to do it tbh. but he basically said our sex lacks passion (as i literally dont do anything during it lmfao) and the part in the dream where the girl was moaning really loudly probably has to do with the fact that im as quiet as a mouse when we do it irl... i just feel so bad because im not sexually satisfying him, but he says he wants to figure this out together no matter what. still im genuinely at a loss bc i dont know how to figure it out and make it better for us, and the fact that he told me that our sex is basically boring (he didnt say those words but he was indicating it tbh), it makes me even more insecure and  want to do it even less, so its really a catch22... do you guys think that the dream means he wants to find someone else? (in his unconscious mind at least bc he always reassures me im the one and he doesnt want anyone else which i fully believe). will we ever be able to figure this out? i truly love him and i just feel so terrible.",2025-03-20 05:55:34,relationship_advice
1jfi6hy,"My (22F) boyfriend (22M) wont take time away from his friends to call me on my birthday, how do I deal with this?","

This is my first time posting but I’m really upset about it. My boyfriend and I have been together 4 years and I’ve spent every birthday with him since I turned 19 (about to turn 23). We are currently long distance and he had a family emergency and cannot travel to see me for my birthday as we had originally planned. Instead my mom is coming to visit me from Friday to Saturday (my birthday is Friday). Now this Saturday is also my school formal which my friends and I plan on going out afterwards to celebrate my birthday. My mom is sleeping in my bedroom since I have a roommate while she stays over so I will not have any alone time while she is here. I explained this all to my boyfriend and asked if we could call after I got home from going out on Saturday so I could tell him about my night. He told me he was seeing his friends Saturday night but could call Friday or Sunday. I explained that Friday i wouldn’t have time for a long conversation since my mom will be staying with me. I further explained that I want to call him when i get home Saturday night so I have someone to talk to while i get unready and can debrief everything. He refused and said that he needed to take the “5 hours on Saturday night to see his friends” i asked him step away for 45 minutes just so we could chat since it’s my birthday and he said he would do no more than 5 minutes. I became really upset and started crying and explained that I felt like he wasn’t being there for me and its my birthday. He told me I was selfish and that it wasn’t my birthday (because my birthday is Friday but I will be celebrating with friends Saturday once my mom leaves). He said i don’t get to dictate his time just because it’s my birthday (for context i love birthdays not just my own and have thrown him surprise parties with all his friends for the past 2 years). I was crying saying that i didn’t feel like a priority and he said I should just break up with him. He’s going through a difficult time at home right now so im trying to be as understanding as I can but i felt like he was being so abrasive and mean. I ended up asking him for 20 minutes instead of 45 to talk and he reluctantly agreed and ended the conversation with “you got what you wanted”.
I feel so unheard and hurt im just looking for advice on what to do or say next.",2025-03-20 05:53:50,relationship_advice
1jfi1bf,my (23f) bf (24m)keeps making sly comments about my size. i’m overweight but ive been this way. is he not attracted anymore?,"so my bf and i have been together a year, when we got together i was 185 lbs, now im 210. obviously i didn’t want to gain 25 lbs and i want to lose weight anyways (used to be about 160 and like my body at that size) but its hard because im in college and working so a lot of my meals are fast food or some quick pasta meal and ive stopped doing my workout classes because im not near the gym anymore. anyways, we were talking about it earlier because i said i wanted to join orange theory again and he said thats good because itll help build muscle which will make me skinny, i said i didnt want to be skinny, just in shape how i used to be but i like my soft chubbiness and curves and he made another comment about health and staying in shape. mind you my bf is fat, like way fatter than me, he also eats like absolute crap. so i feel it’s not only hypocritical but it also hurt my feelings. if he wanted to date a skinny girl he should’ve dated a skinny girl. i’m already insecure and now he’s making it worse because he’s treating me as if im disgusting when im not. 

i don’t want to be sensitive but it truly did hurt my feelings and now i feel like he doesn’t find me attractive at all anymore.  shouldi say something to him or get over it? ",2025-03-20 05:43:33,relationship_advice
1jfhzlu,How do I (24F) ask my situationship (27M) to start reciprocating more?,"
I have been in a sorta fwb/situationship for around four months now, we hang out a few times a week and really enjoy each others company whether we’re just chilling watching movies or in the bedroom, but bedroom is not the biggest part of the relationship. For over a month now nothing has been reciprocated, and I mean nothing. He’ll happily accept whatever I want to give him and I’ll give him whatever he asks for. We’ve only had sex in total a handful of times(10?) and I’m pretty positive he’s cum every time and same with oral/hand which we seem to do a little more often than sex. However every time we’ve had sex before I haven’t been able to cum but I don’t think it’s anything he’s doing wrong, it feels like I have some kind of mental block or anxiety around it and just haven’t been able to, but I do still like everything about the sex regardless of if I’m having an orgasm or not. I’m partly worried that he might be feeling insecure or doesn’t really want to engage in sex anymore because he just knows I won’t cum. I’ve tried to communicate the ways I think will make me have an orgasm told him that when I’m on my own I have a much easier time with “external” rather than “internal” stimulation and  have heavily implied I want him to eat me out, which he never has. He has asked for me to do the same on him which I’ve never said no when he’s asked, but why hasn’t he just naturally reciprocated that type of effort? He does seem to be very willing to satisfy me but I think he needs to satisfy me in different ways from his previous relationships to be successful. I’m not the kind of person to just ask for what I want straight up, I barely know what I do want, so asking someone to do something like oral feels like a big (weird/gross?) thing to try and do. How can I get more of what I want from this relationship without feeling insecure with my body or having a really awkward and uncomfortable conversation?",2025-03-20 05:40:10,relationship_advice
1jfhww9,My girlfriend (25f) lied about who sexually abused her to me (30m). What is the best way forward?,"Hello, Ive been dating a girl for awhile, and Ive never been more connected to someone in my life. We spent 12 hours a day together with effortless conversation. I came from an abusive relationship where my previous ex of 2ish years used suicide as a tool to manipulate me, and she came from a relationship where she had to file for a restraining order, so we felt comfortable enough to share these things with one another. We spent night after night talking, and sharing ourselves with each other, and I finally thought I had found someone genuine.

She is a dance instructor and told me that her mom (who tried to groom her at 14 years old with another man) wanted her to marry a rich student of hers (70 years of age) in order to become rich once he died ""soon.""

She discussed these things with me and shared that this man had abused her over and over during private dinners after competitions. Some examples were ""telling me that he wanted to put a dildo inside of me while we ate together,"" ""kissing me during lessons,"" and ""aggressively grabbing my neck and forcing me to embrace him,"" which, obviously I was VERY uncomfortable with.

This man lived 3 hours away, but she saw him regularly for events and competitions. I told her that I did not feel comfortable with them being together, having dinner (which is common for teachers and students to do during competitions in dance), and spending time between lesson sessions privately etc.

She told me that I did not trust her enough to be independent and defend herself, to which I replied that I totally trusted her, but I didnt feel comfortable with her being in private with a man who has physically, and sexually, abused her in the past, because he could do the same in the future.

Eventually, I agreed to be comfortable with the two of them doing competitions together, and everything resolved. Until he began to text her and her mom in a group chat, which resulted in her mom begging the girl I was dating to move back home to meet this man again.

She continued to text this ""abusive"" man after I expressed concern about his and her past, and the fact that I felt it was inappropriate to text her and her mom (mostly because it was against the studio rules for students to contact teachers directly). She assured me that she was being safe and that I had nothing to worry about.

I put my foot down, and said that I did not feel comfortable with her talking to a man that was actively abusing her, sexually and physically, and that her mom was also actively trying to get my girlfriend to gold dig this man.

I stopped talking to her, and my girlfriend began to use suicide as a tool against me, similarly to my previous relationship of abuse. I told her that I would never be comfortable with her around someone that has laid their hands on my girlfriend in an aggressive way, let alone the sexual nature of his abuse.

She defended the man, her student, over and over, to which I was very confused and hurt. I questioned why should she would defend this abusive man, and eventually she cracked. She told me that she had made up the entire story about her 70 year old student being abusive, and that he actually was a very nice man, basically a ""father figure"" to her, and that the abusive person was someone that she saw every day, and didn't want to tell me because she didnt want me to react to him in person and ""embarrass her.""

She made the story up about the 70 year old student that was far away because she ""thought he would be too far her me to worry about,"" but when he texted her and her mom she felt she ""had to tell me the truth, because the old man didnt deserve"" her ""lies.""

I have never mentioned that I intended to go and see this 70 year old student (before I knew she was lying about him), or confront him in any way. I was just upset that she was continuing to allow herself to be around him and allow him to buy her dresses (sometimes upwards to 10k) and buy her other goods.

I have blocked her, but I genuinely feel really bad because this girl is someone I have never felt this deep of a connection with. Did I make the right decision after finding out that she lied about this 70 year old student 3 hours away sexually abusing her, and that it was actually a student of hers that she sees every day?",2025-03-20 05:34:49,relationship_advice
1jfhwb3,I (23M) am having trouble talking about my feelings towards my Girlfriend (21F) who I've been dating for 6 months and I tried to explain how I feel but somehow made things worse. How can I phrase things better for next time?,"I would like to start out by saying I'm kinda new to reddit so if I say something that's against the rules I sincerely apologize. Anyway, my girlfriend and I have been dating for 6 months. We met at Goodwill and worked together for a bit until she got fired for missing so many work days. Ever since she got fired, I've been paying for quite a bit of her stuff. She has asked me for alcohol, vapes, food, etc. At first I never really had a problem with it because I thought she'd try to find a job in no time. 5 months have passed and she still hasn't found a job but rather, is doing school so she can get her GED/diploma(I forgot which one). The school also had this program where she can get paid a certain amount of money if she did at least 20 hours of school a week. Unfortunately she comes up with excuses such as, she's too tired to do school and sleeps almost the whole day, or she's too hungover to do school. All she has to do is some pretty simple math and writing and etc. It's nothing hard at all and she knows that. The problem is getting her to do the work fully knowing she can get paid and buy her own vapes and alcohol (Keep in mind I've been paying for her vapes and alcohol these past months and I'm tired of caring for both of us). I still work at goodwill and get paid $16/hr which is barely enough for my expenses alone. Just last night I talked to her about how I've been doing a lot for her and that it's time she buys her own things at this point. She tells me that she didn't ask me to buy her those things (granted she only said this ONE time and I bought it for her anyways so I will take the blame for this one.) On multiple occasions I'd go to the dispensary to grab some edibles and she goes up to me and says ""Babe that's not fair, you get to get high but I can't get drunk?"" Which makes me feel guilty so I go ahead and buy her some ofcourse. I love and care for her but if one guy is working minimum wage for 2 people, I won't be able to afford the things I need for the future. She always talks to me about doing her school work or getting a part-time job but I see no progress in either side. I tried to talk to her about it but somehow I ended up being the bad guy. She said I sound mean when try to tell her things like this and that I make her feel guilty on purpose. That wasn't my goal at all obviously. I even tried changing my tone because tbh I can come off a bit strong sometimes. But that didn't work. I would also like to say I've given her multiple massages even on nights I'm too tired too. I've cooked her food for every hangover she has gotten. I'll admit I'm not always nice but that's not to say I'm being mean. Sometimes I feel I need to put my foot down but the moment I do all barrels are pointed towards me. A never ending cycle I wish to get out of. I try to make things right. I wish she'd put a little more effort into this relationship as much as I do. (I'm not talking about buying each other things). I don't know what I'm saying anymore. As of now I've been awake for more than 15hrs so I guess I'm just too tired and said something stupid to her. She's not all bad either though. She was there for me when my cat died. She was there when I had to work alone and I was always on the phone with her. I have no clue how a relationship is suppose to work or who's right and who's wrong. This is my first one ever and I feel like it's heading down a dark road.",2025-03-20 05:33:41,relationship_advice
1jfhvq7,Am I (23F) being ghosted by him (25M)? (Or is it just hot n cold communication),"For context, we started talking almost a month ago and went on 1 date. But Ramadan started the very next day so obviously it’s been hard to see each other. But since that date we have been texting and calling consistently. So every day we would text or at least call. He calls me names like bae, baby, love, princess… ect. 

He also talks about all the dates we’re gonna go on when Ramadan ends. He also made it very clear that he’s not cutting me off whatsoever for Ramadan and is very willing to speak to me during it. So I’m just not gonna use that as an excuse. But up until 1 week ago he stopped answering messages so quick or I’d be the first to text or call. Today was the first day in basically 1 month of talking where there was zero communication. Also mind you 2 years ago when I briefly met him and he hit on me, I curved him. Also up until recently his friends have been egging my friends on to set us up in a date and it seems like he was really into me. 

Now I think that once he has gotten me, he’s bored because there is no chase. But at the end of the day I don’t know the true answer. I don’t know if I’m about to literally be ghosted because this is day 1 of no contact. Alsooo I may have been over bearing? But like not rlly. It’s just that recently I have been texting him first, calling, sending funny TikTok’s. I also asked him Monday to please see me this week n he seemed not inclined. But I’m only acting this way cus I thought it was okay bc he was acting this way towards me this whole time. So like idk. 

Am I being ghosted. And is he just really not that into me perhaps? Let me know comment down below. Also a girl can really use advice on what to do going forwards in this situation.",2025-03-20 05:32:38,relationship_advice
1jfhs87,I (F22) snopped on my bf (M21)’s phone and found chats with his ex about them wanting to try again. Any advice on what to do?,"Context. I’ve been dating my boyfriend since 5 months ago. We started dating pretty fast and we even moved in together like 2 weeks ago. I am a very open person, and i’ve talked about the only ex i’ve ever had and all my sexual experiences. He is the type of guy who needs to be in a relarionship to engage sexually. The times that I have asked about his ex, he has been really quiet about it. Hasn’t said much and always brings up that I always bring her up and he doesn’t bring up my ex like I do. He would avoid the question about what happened with his ex and even more why they don’t follow each other even though they broke up having good terms. I recently saw that his ex had her ig account public and saw that he liked a picture in the same month that we met. He decided not to tell me when they stopped talking even though they were actively talking until he met me (or even started liking me, idk). So, i decided that I would check his phone to see if he still has her contact. I found out that she is still in her contacts and also found their IG chats. In these messages he was telling her that she was the only one and blah, blah, blah… that they should get back together and stuff. Last year she also asked him that they should get back together and he replied a bit late but said that they should. That is the last message that I read. Reading all this has made me so uncomfortable because he wouldn’t share anything about them. I believe he is still in love with her because he hasn’t gotten rid of those messages or the pictures within the chats. Any advice on what to say to him about that?

1jfhpxu,How can I [20F] ask my partner [21F] to take more initiative?,"My partner and I have been together for about a year now. I love her dearly, and we have done so much for each other. We were long distance for about 8 months of our relationship, not seeing each other once-- due to unfortunate timing of things, and our respective locations. I know that she cares about me a lot, but it often feels like she doesn't show it. She never texts me unless I text her first, and she doesn't ask me to spend time with her or plan dates or anything, it's always me doing that. It often feels like I am putting in all the effort in the relationship. I have talked to her about texting me more (especially because we will have to be long distance again soon, and it is so exhausting being the only one to text). I also talked to her about asking me to spend time with her. But, nothing has really changed. I would also just appreciate random acts of kindness like I do for her, but I don't know how to ask for that without sounding greedy. Anyways, I'm not sure what to do, because I've already talked to her about this and nothing has changed. We have gone through so much together, and love each other a lot, so I of course don't want to end things or anything like that. How can I ask her to do these things for me, without seeming too self centered- and in a way that would work?

1jfhfpm,My (19M) girlfriend (20F) made a very uncomfortable comment regarding getting a gun. Did I overreact?,"For some background information, me and my girlfriend have been in a bit of a rough patch lately. She's been fairly stressed about some things regarding paperwork, and not really letting me help.

I grew up in a fairly unhealthy home, I've experienced alot of bad things regarding guns and losing family members, I've had to intervene and often got hurt in the process. I am in no way trying to defend my side here, but attempting to give a bit more insight on why I acted so harshly.

As my girlfriend got ready for work, she was walking me through why she felt so stressed and overwhelmed. Mentioning things such as important paperwork, insurance (we got into a minor car accident last month), and other things. Typical stressful things as we're transitioning to live by ourselves, which is very new to her. I offered to help, personally I love doing paperwork and handling this stuff, as I usually do these things for her anyway. But she completely flipped out.

She started saying things about how she can't do anything right and is always saying the wrong things, and I apologized incase I made her feel like she was being judged and that I didn't mean it like that.

Another important piece of information, I've really been wanting to go camping. In my own personal life I've been working through some stuff with family, and my escape has always kind of been going away from town and people for awhile. My girlfriend doesn't like the idea of camping without a gun, it's been a source of recent arguments. I can handle a gun, I've grown up with them, I know what they can do, I don't want a gun. I can handle myself without it, and we aren't planning on hunting, or even going so far out we'd need a gun, we'd be around other people.

Anyway, back to what she said. She essentially said getting a gun would end her troubles. And my first response was ""that is not an okay joke."", I thought she was joking. She responded with ""You don't trust me?"" And I said ""Not if you think that stuff is funny.""

This ended up spiraling into a bigger argument. She went off to say even if she did do something like that, I wouldn't be able to stop her, she'd simply leave to do whatever she planned. I told her again, that wasn't funny, and it's very serious what's she saying and I need to know if she's serious or not.

She then went on to say I wouldn't be able to disarm her, again reinstating that I couldn't do anything. I told her she can forget about getting a gun or even touching one if she thought this was okay, and that I'd never trust her to handle a gun. She left for work without another word, and isn't responding to me.

I know that was probably very harsh, and I definitely could've handled it better. I love my girlfriend, and it's no way her responsibility to censor herself to avoid my traumas. It definitely doesn't help that we're in a bit of a rough patch right now, we've both grown alot with mental health but I guess I'm still scared. She knows about my past, I'm very open about my PTSD and family background as it's important, we live together. I don't know how to approach this conversation without her feeling like I'm judging her, but those were very serious comments. Any advice?",2025-03-20 05:02:56,relationship_advice
1jfhfpf,How terrible of an idea is it for me (F 31) to do a French exit in a 3 year relationship?,"I've been with my bf for 3 years. Most of it being a really difficult time. We have no family near us, and originally we talked about relocating during the 3rd year of our relationship to be closer to my family. 
He's shown no interest to move or actually do anything to progress our relationship and continuously blames it on me. I've talked with him about leaving, but haven't been taken seriously. 
I feel defeated, but I haven't brought myself to end it and know that if I have any contact with him it will just be harder for me. 
I'm considering taking what I can with me, writing a letter, and leaving while he is at work then blocking him.
I am sad to be losing so much stuff, but I don't really have the means or energy to move the things on my own. 
Some of my friends say it's messed up to leave him with all of my stuff, but I already feel like I've wasted time with him and know he always convinced me to try and work things out- but yet again does nothing on his end afterwards. 

*edit/update- 
-He has 3 cameras surrounding our place. He'd know if I have anyone over to help me/if I move too much stuff. If I turn the cameras off he will become upset and suspicious as well. He only works a few minutes away. 
-it would cost me approximately $4000 to rent a uhaul and move my things to where I live anyway, and i don't have enough belongings to justify that. Even though our relationship has been so terrible at times I still feel some guilt leaving him with my mess of belongings... but the other part of me does not as I've felt he has pushed me to this point. 
-my friends and family are 3000 miles away 
-if I end it on ""good terms"" he WILL very likely show up at my home 3000 miles away.

1jfheqr,"GF (F34) is the worst experience (2 years) ( M35 ) in my life, was it worth? Why she behave like that?","At first it seemed like we was made for each other and had too much coïncidences and the love was like magic. We was best friends and soulmates. But quick I realised that something was wrong. Her temper was to be quick in anger and very jalous. In 2 years she broke up every week with me. She didn‘t care if I was in Family Celebrations or Friends birthday or even at work. She was always jalous and very possessive. Accused me of cheating and insulted me. I thought  if I (34) proof to her that she was making movies in her mind and was wrong it would get better, but I was heavely mistaken. Now every where I go I must respond the telephone make localisation, send pictures or proofs. At work, with friends or even when I go buying groceries. Even after all this she still leaves me bc she simply like more her theories, no matter how absurde they were…
I was a very confident men and work as a social worker. Slowly I became depressed bc of the constant insults and accusations. I didn‘t want to lose her. So I always came back to her and begged her to stay with me. This gave her a powerful position in our relationship and she took it to the max. If I would not do as she wishes, it would be war! Pick me up, don‘t go out with friends, send me proofs etc.
It was very exhausting and at night 4 am when I sleep she called me to ask if I‘m with a girl. I must to respond always the phone or I‘m a cheater… She knew I love her too much. I even cried before her and begged her to stop the constant pressure. But she didn’t care. When I broke up with her she showed up at my door and accuses me that I did it bc I have another. I didn‘t want to be the bad guy. I wanted always that she appreciate me and see the person that I am. But no matter how good I treated her, she just remembers the negativ and recognize no good. Relative the positive and insist‘s on the negatif. Every time we was not fighting the love was very high and it felt surreal. I became too attached. I just wanted this to work. But it was impossible to last. Every week she found another reason to be mad and break up. I was walking on egg shells. The reason I kept with her is that she was gorgeous and represented a escape from the world for me. Like video games. I knew that some trauma or past experience made her like this so I felt bad for her and thought I must save her. In the process I lost myself. Family, Friends and Co workers noticed my nervous behaviour. My mind was constantly in fear, sadness and anger. I could not focus on work or enjoy the evening with friends, family if she break up and block. I hope God forgives me for my foolishness and help me get back on track.

1jfheho,Girlfriend (F 28) is shutting down due to stress and feels guilty about how much she loves me (M 33),"We’ve been together for four years, and we’ve had our fair share of hardship due to life throwing curveballs at us. I should mention that she was diagnosed with ADHD during our relationship. Things have been great between us, and we’ve always supported each other (honestly she’s more often been my rock), but recently life has been bearing down on her relentlessly. Her father is terminally ill and it is devastating, and her job consists of speaking with people who have severe PTSD and she’s overworked to a ridiculous degree. The combination of this has caused her to basically shut down, we live together but she goes nonverbal often, she’s basically a shell of herself with me and her friends. 

She feels so guilty about this that anytime I bring it up she will immediately become overwhelmed and begin crying about how guilty she feels about it, how she loves me so much, and she’s afraid I will resent her no matter what happens. I try to assure her that I understand, that I only have empathy for her, and that my only worry is that she’s going to end things with me because she can’t handle this self imposed guilt.

I’m unsure of how to help, I don’t know if I should just leave, because the worry of losing her is honestly causing me a lot of stress and I’m obviously causing her a lot of guilt in an already difficult time. I’ve never seen her shut down like this for so long, and I’m trying to help her through it, but she’s so stubbornly independent that she has a hard time accepting help (while ironically always wanting to help me). She also has an extremely difficult time opening up about her feelings due to growing up with parents that would shut her down for doing so, so she’s been bottling everything up. 

What can I do to show her she doesn’t need to feel guilty? How do I show her I’m here to support and not hinder her? Any advice is appreciated.",2025-03-20 05:00:54,relationship_advice
1jfhbml,Partner ‘32M’ changed after I ‘32F’ say I’d leave. Now (3mo later) he is back to old self again.,"My partner for almost 5 years wanted to break up five months ago. We share 2 boys ‘2M’ and ‘3m’ age. Two months later (3 mo ago) he asked for an opportunity and to get married. 

He started helping at the house and with the kids. However, a month already he has been back to his same old habits of not helping at all, not paying attention to the kids, always spent his time of the phone, too tired to do anything, and  “he is the one that works.” 

Since I have been feeling rage about the situation, I have started to become violent throwing stuff, breaking plates on purpose or hitting things (but I never was like that before).

Now I’m considering if I really want to marry him or if I’m just trying to marry him because we have been together for five years or if it is truly love. 

I feel bad for doubting but I don’t want to spend the rest of my life like these.

1jfh49u,Where could this relationship be heading? Me (35m) and my wife (35f),"We’ve been together for 11 years and have a 1 year old, cutest thing in the world.

My wife cheated on me after 3 years of marriage. She claims she couldn’t accept my porn addiction. We were apart for 6 months when she was with another guy. During that time I saw other women, purely for sex. I was too devastated to open up for long term relationships at the time. I also video taped some of the sex I had and kept the videos for the next 7 years and sometimes masterbated to them whenever my wife and I got into fights. We rarely have sex, I would say once every 1-2 months. The sexless life has been going on for probably the last 8 years.

I have a high libido, she does not.

About 6 months ago she found my sex tapes with other girls and this obviously devastated her. We’ve been in constant fights since. We are in couples therapy now (3 sessions so far) I am trying to fight the porn addiction but it’s hard when we haven’t had any sex especially since she found my videos. I destroyed the videos as soon as I could so she doesn’t go over watch it again.

It seems like it’s too late for us. We both love our son so much, and would hate to not give him the ideal family.

I want to have some opinions about if it’s really too late for us or not?

I really hope it’s not too late, but it seems my porn addiction has ruined our relationship beyond repair. 

I would do anything, and I know ending the porn addiction is top priority. However, she seems to not care anymore, fed up with me, and doesn’t believe that I will end the addiction. I don’t know where she’s at, but maybe she just waiting for more reasons or the right opportunity for her to leave me again.",2025-03-20 04:42:19,relationship_advice

1jfgrv8,(F30) can I live with (M35) that lacks emotional intelligence,"

I (F30) started dating my partner (M35) during one of the most challenging times in my life—I was dealing with a serious medical issue. He felt like a breath of fresh air, so different from the type of men I usually went for. However, from the beginning, I had this feeling that he lacked experience with women and dating. Despite that, I didn’t hold him to the same standards as my exes because, at the time, I was focused on my health rather than my usual love for romance, fine dining, and the finer things in life.  

As my health improved, I started feeling emotionally needy and went to therapy, thinking my illness had made me more sensitive. But through therapy, I realized that what I was struggling with wasn’t just about me—I concluded that he lacks emotional intelligence. That’s not something I can teach him, and instead of expecting more from him, I was told I needed to accept him as he is.  

Another challenge is intimacy. Before marriage, I had never been with anyone—I was a virgin—while he had experience. Naturally, I expected him to take the lead, but he doesn’t crave intimacy the way I assumed men do. Initially, I thought it was my fault, but when we finally talked about it, he blamed it on ED and performance anxiety, which got worse after I cried once when he couldn’t perform.  

Overall, he is a good man who is trying, but he’s extremely focused on a big dream he’s chasing. While I admire his ambition, he dedicates so much time to it that other aspects of life—our relationship included—are being neglected. Now that my health has improved, he wants to have a child. But as a hopeless romantic, I can’t help but wonder: if he already struggles with romance and understanding me as a woman, won’t parenting make things even harder?  

I don’t want to settle for the bare minimum, but I also don’t want to break up a functional home over what might seem like small things. My gut feeling is telling me something isn’t right, but is this just insecurity? Am I asking for too much? Or do I need to demand change and make sure I’m loved the way I need to be? I know he struggles with expressing his emotions, and I overthink everything, which means I often have to read between the lines. But should love really feel like this much work?

1jfgovx,How do I 18F tell my friend 18 NB I don’t enjoy talking to them anymore?,"
Hi! There’s a lot that goes into this story and I’m a horrible writer please give me some mercy. Please let me know if I did this wrong, I'm not good at posting.

I (18F) need to tell my friend (18nb) that their obsession with a “situationship” is genuinely making them a dislikeable person. I’ll add some back story, then the reason I am coming here for advice. 

My friend Jones (fake names) had an almost relationship with an (at the time) very good friend of ours Levi (19m). We had all been friends since middle school. Levi had bad luck with dating in high school that usually ended up destroying any community that happened to be involved. Simply put, Levi was a twat as soon as he got into a relationship. Around this time last year Jones told me they have had feelings for Levi for since middle school. I told them I can’t see it going well for anyone, but to trust their gut.  

Apparently, Jones’ gut told them to sneak Levi over at night multiple times, flirt with them, then one time get MEGA drunk with him then get very friendly. The morning after Levi says he’s not looking for a relationship then swiftly moves away for college.  

Jones delt with this in a very Jones way, I mean they were already OBSESSED with Levi at this point. Jones would on and off message Levi. For a while Levi would message back. It was weird, Levi was stringing Jones along for some sympathy and attention. Sometime in November he blocked Jones on everything. Jones didn't handle this well. They wouldn’t stop ranting about Levi, and other cliche things that come after rejection. Most notably they flirted and messed around with a few guys, one of them fell “desperately in love” with Jones. Jones dropped them as soon as the guy wanted to get serious. 

At some points of the Colossal Crash-out I genuinely thought Jones was experiencing psychosis or mania (not sure if they are connected, I'm stupid). Nowadays, I truly do not recognize or even enjoy talking to Jones. EVERY conversation they find a way to talk about Levi. Whether it’s an “I miss him”, “He would have loved this reel”, “I hate him”, or SOMEHOW connecting him to the current topic.  

This is my main problem with Jones. It’s been going on for months now. I genuinely can’t go to Jones with my problems (or literally anything) because they just want to talk about Levi. I feel so overlooked and it’s really hurting me. Especially since my door is always open when Jones needs a place to vent, which they do often.  

 

Now the reason I’m asking for advice: Jones has a lot of mental illnesses/sensitivities. Because of this I’m not sure how to approach this convo in the best way.  

I’ll give some random examples so hopefully you can understand what Jones is like.

* Most times when I bring up my problems Jones either mentions how they are going through the same thing but worse or another thing that’s also worse. Whether it’s social, economic, physical, or mental they always are going through something more important. I would be fine with this if Jones would just say “I'm sorry you're dealing with that” instead of “oh my gosh saammmeee its literally killing me etc...” 

* When I told them I didn't think trying to get with Levi was a good idea, Jones got upset. “I can’t change how I feel” “You don’t get to decide what I do” “why can’t you just be happy for me?”. I truly was trying my best to be empathetic, but it didn't work. 

* Once they involved me in some juvenile drama in a way that I felt was disrespectful. When I asked why I had to be brought up Jones got upset. They said I wasn’t being supportive and should stand behind everything they do. 

* Once Jones got the idea to cosplay with me. They told me their costume idea then proposed an idea for me. I didn’t like it at all, they were telling me what to wear, how to act, and making all creative decisions for me. I gently told them I wanted to do my own thing. Jones got pouty and said, “but it would be so much fun” “pleeaasse, I have a vision”. So, I just had to do what they wanted. 

* Once in a group chat Jones was talking about a mutual friend that didn’t want to block their abusive ex. A girl in the chat said it was weird that the ex still wasn’t blocked. Jones blew up at them saying stuff like “I’m going to pretend I didn’t see that” “only the victim choses how to heal” “you should support (mutual friend) not judge their choice of healing”. 

(Sorry, this is so bitter, I’ve never really gone to anyone about this, so it’s been building for a while) 

So, Jones is a stonewall when it comes to honest advice/critiques. How can I tell them that this is effecting our relationship to the point where I don’t want to talk to them. I don’t want to give up on this friendship we still sometimes have that spark and we've known each other since kindergarten. We are going to be around each other for a while, and I don’t want to burn bridges. 

 

TL;DR My friend got blocked by an almost relationship 7ish months ago, it’s ALL they talk about. I’m sick of it and want to voice that, but the friend is very sensitive to any type of back lash. How do I mention my grievances?  ",2025-03-20 04:15:45,relationship_advice
1jfgopf,"Mother-in-law (65F) is insufferable/defensive when it comes to discussing money and is causing unnecessary arguments with my wife(35F, the daughter) and MIL's husband(70M). How should my wife talk to her about it?","I'm sorry this is so long, please bear with me. 

**Background on the relationship**

* MIL/FIL are estranged. No one knows why but consensus is they have lived apart too long (different countries). MIL now hates FIL, FIL still tries to be responsible husband (he gave her some pocket when he last visited)
* MIL lives in the house they bought together but mostly paid for by FIL and later by my wife and I after he retired. From what I know, MIL didn't pay any part of the loan, except for annual property tax which is not a significant amount
* My wife and I live in our own home (same country as MIL)

MIL is quite a defensive person. Anyone who remotely say anything that makes her *feel* she's not good enough, she'll start deflecting and argue - although no one actually said anything to accuse her of anything. This has caused plenty of arguments between my wife and her for the tiniest thing for no real reasons, and she uses hurtful words and emotional blackmail, and because of this, she also doesn't have good relationship with her own siblings. She's not like this to 'outsider' like friends or me. It's worse if it's about money. Without going into details, MIL is a money-minded person. 

FIL on the other hand, is chill and avoid arguing to save his energy (which is fair). But my opinion is, him being away has left my wife to deal with MIL.

My wife was taught since young to be respectful so she seldom talks back. So my MIL has no one to 'stop' her. As for me, I can't stand MIL's attitude but I avoid saying anything out of respect (during arguments)  since it's their family issues (not sure if i'm right to think like this). My own mom advice me to stay out of it too. 

**Problem**

They have decided to rent out a room (the house MIL is in), and my wife and I facilitated the discussion about rental - MIL/FIL agreed to 50/50 split months ago. Rental is to be paid to MIL and split out to FIL. Recently wife asked how is she planning to transfer FIL's share of the rent, she was unhappy that we asked that question, but we are asking because we don't want to leave things in the grey and, MIL is not good with planning. (i personally don't agree MIL is holding the rental money anyways)

My wife and I decided that it is easier that my wife handles the rental money and transfer out to them monthly instead - to avoid potential conflict. Also, they are both getting old and not good with technologies, and we thought it'll make their lives easier that we handle the affairs.  FIL has no issue with it but when MIL heard about it she literally went berserk. Saying that she's the owner (she forgot about FIL and he mostly paid for the hse) and why money goes to my wife, started complaining about all the cleaning she does at home (although we offered to help and she said no), and bringing in all irrelevant issues. In the end, she now wants 60/40 share for no real reason!

As expected FIL said ok when my wife asked him. But it's unfair. She consulted a trusted elder relative and she said we did the right thing (handling the rent) and that it is unfair for MIL to ask for more, and that wife cannot allow this otherwise she will regret it (for not fixing this now). So, now wife needs to talk to her mom again and who knows what bomb she'll detonate. 

**My questions**

1. My wife is stuck between her parents, and I know this will take a lot of energy from her, and she's not used to challenging someone in this manner. I have been helping to prep her and how my MIL might react. Anyone have advice to share on how to deal with someone like MIL?
2. I told her i think i shouldn't be present when they speak face-to-face, don't want to give the impression that MIL is outnumbered. What do you think?

btw, we are Asians if that helps frame things. O\_O

**tl;dr**: MIL wants more share of the rent for no real reason, and now wife has to challenge her and put her back in her place. 

Thank you for reading!

1jfgkeg,How do I (33M) ask my friends to spare me the details of my ex-girlfriend's (30F) recent cheating?,"My ex-girlfriend T(30F) and I (33M) have been together for the last two years. A week ago she went to a party. I couldn't attend because I had to work but some of my closest friends were there. They told me afterwards that three hours into the party and seven shots of Jager later, she was in the bedroom with another guy.

They could hear everything, and I've since broken up with her. What's worse she was wearing my Offspring t-shirt and left it there. Well-meaning friends have told me about how her feet was all up in the air, and how long it was taking.

Since the incident, I've asked my friends to please stop telling me about it. I mean, I'm not the one who acted like a 'ho so why must I be the one who has to know? In the nicest possible way I've said I'm not the one who messed up big time so spare me the details if you don't mind.

Now I can understand friends who want to tell me, think they're gonna help me open up my eyes, but the play-by-play makes me want to lose it. Every time they tell me, man it turns the knife.

1jfgipy,I (23F) am ready to break up with my boyfriend (23M),"I am nervous posting, as it is my first time, and this is a painful part of my young life. Also, I apologize if there is spelling or grammar mistakes.

Let me give you a bit of back story on us. I have talked to a few people before him
but this was my first real relationship and my first love. We have been together for 4 years. Met online when I was 19 and he was 20. WE FELL HARD! At the time I was working retail and went through 3 jobs in the course of our relationship, and I won’t specify his job (Too specific) but he was legally able to make $100,000+ a year for practically laying in bed. We went on many trips in our first year, spent a lot of time together because of our flexible schedules, he really liked to buy me flashy things, eventually he even gifted me my second car. It was seemingly perfect. 

Looking back, I had rose colored glasses on majority of the time. The arguments started early in our relationship. Beginning with trust issues because of his “ex”, accusing me of cheating on him, having notifications on my location of when i leave and arrive to my home and work, a lot of blame being placed on me for our moods and arguments, saw attempts on his phone to meet up with local onlyfans models/strippers for money, and replying/engaging with their instagrams, searching models a brothel in our state, there was a point we took a break and he texted another random girl on instagram for support. I confronted him before said break, and since then have never heard of or seen anything on his phone. 

I have since moved past a lot of these things because I loved him so much at the time. But to this day, there are still many things he gets mad over things out of my control. Like when I fall asleep and don’t tell him good night, or if i’m too tired to come over after work, or when I spend too much time away from him. Majority of the time, I plan when we’ll be going out, ALWAYS pack our bags and plan vacations, make sure we are both fed throughout the day, make all our our haircut, oil change, doctor, optometrist, you fucking name it appointments. 

While he gets to stay at home, and I now work at an engineering company 40+ hours a week for 2 years now. Initially we only lived about 25-30 minutes apart. Now he lives 50 miles away. Now don’t get me wrong, I was diagnosed Bipolar II 20 so I have done my fair share of arguing and I know that there are things i’ve done that have hurt him too. Some things I never apologized for, some things I begged for forgiveness. 

Don’t get me wrong, there are still really good times in our relationship, and there’s times I really feel like I did before, Like he was my favorite person in the world. But the bad times only bring up all these thoughts for me.

The last thing I am going to mention in this entire story, is that I do the ENTIRETY of the driving. I can count on one hand the amount of times I’ve know of hims driving anywhere, let alone to visit me in my own home (I live in a 6 bedroom house with one of my siblings, going on a year).

I’m sure you can tell where my head is at by the way I am typing all of this. I just needed to put it all into words for my own sake. And I am giving the people an opportunity to give me you anything opinion. What would you guys do in my situation? I am open to all bloodshed.",2025-03-20 04:05:28,relationship_advice

However, we were in almost the same realm of people/ acquaintances for work (I was a model, he was a CEO).  We’ll say my BFs name is Tom. The issue is that before (4 years before) I even knew Tom, I had a very short relationship with Jim, who Tom and I ended up both knowing. I had no idea, and I assume they have some type of beef with each other since Tom told me to unfollow him, and telling me how he doesn’t like Jim, etc. I feel so bad that I had relations with Jim. I unfollowed and blocked quickly as what we had was YEARS ago, Jim has a girlfriend now so everything was very platonic since then. Anyways, no issue with me erasing him out of my life. But I know Tom would be so upset if I told him about the 1 month fling me and Jim had. Tom has a history as well, as you can imagine. And we are very open with each other about it, but I’m worried that this may be prying too much into my life or is uneccesary for me to bring up since at the end of the day, it’s just another ex.

1jfl3k6,Hooked up with a nasty Oldman and then felt disgusted after I came. 18+,"
So I met this man online. He’s 59, older than my dad. I’m 23. I was always turned on by the thought of being “used” by an Oldman. As we communicated he figured out I have some kind of daddy issue. We decided to meet. I got drunk but not too drunk. Although we did have normal conversations, in between he would tell me how he wanted to just grab me or pinch my nipples in public and make me moan. (I have super sensitive nipples by the way) He kept giving me the looks. I’m not gonna lie I was HORNY AF hearing all that and wanted to live out my fantasy. So I let him pinch my nipples while we were in the pub and I don’t even know if others saw or not cuz I was busy melting down there. We agreed to go back to his hotel room to continue the fun. I was really looking forward to it and he started to do things as soon as we got into the lift and once we were inside his room, he started calling me names and told me I’m a dirty little bitch. He was all over me and I loved every bit of it. He shoved his tongue down my throat (literally) licked sucked rubbed and pinched my breasts thoroughly and when he slid his fingers into my panties we both were surprised as to how wet I was. So he continued to suck my boobs and play with my p*ssy reminding me how much of a sl*t I am and calling me names. I had a very strong orgasm BUT during the orgasm I became very aware of what was happening and I felt disgusted and terrible. So much that I got goosebumps. I couldn’t wait to get out of there and go home and cry. And that was exactly what I did. I didn’t give him a proper explanation and just left. I felt so used and dirty that I wanted to rip my skin off or erase that memory. I blocked him after that. I’m so confused. 
The worst part is, even after feeling terrible the next day thinking back to all that he did to me I found myself masturbating and wanting the same thing again. Even as I am typing this I’m feeling horny.

1jfkbos,Doni have somethinf undiagnoswd???,"Hey, I’m struggling a lot mentally, and I’ve been trying to figure out what’s wrong with me. I don’t want to self-diagnose, but I feel like I have real issues that are affecting my life. I’d appreciate any insights from people who have gone through similar things or have experience with mental health.

My Symptoms & Struggles:
	•	Extreme mood swings – I can feel confident and powerful one moment, then completely worthless the next, multiple times a day.
	•	Emotional outbursts – Sometimes I get really angry or aggressive without wanting to, and I regret it later.
	•	Self-worth issues – I either see myself as better than others or completely trash. No in-between.
	•	Identity confusion – I don’t know who I really am, what I like, or what my personality is.
	•	Overanalyzing everything – I think deeply about every small action, to the point where life feels unnatural and disconnected.
	•	Paranoia & hypervigilance – I feel like people might betray me or have hidden intentions.
	•	Fear of intimacy – I find it hard to express love, even to my girlfriend. Sometimes I cringe at closeness.
	•	Cutting people off easily – If someone hurts me even slightly, I instantly want to drop them from my life.
	•	Dissociation & numbness – I feel detached from reality at times, like I’m watching life from a distance.
	•	Lack of discipline & motivation – I struggle with school, focusing, and getting things done, even though I want to improve.
	•	Self-sabotage – When things go well, I mess them up, and I don’t know why.
	•	Deep trauma & family issues – My father is extremely controlling and emotionally abusive. He gaslights me, threatens me, and denies all responsibility. My mother shifts between understanding me and siding with my father.
	•	Repressed childhood stress – I don’t remember huge parts of my past, but I know I was mistreated emotionally.",2025-03-20 08:39:53,therapy
1jfjjh8,Is it actual trauma or drama like they said,"Soooo uhhh I have something I have been wondering and i thought why not ask on reddit so i search and found this sub so im gonna ask and see if it truly is trauma or just me being dramatic

So in 6th grade we had a field trip to Shimla and keep in mind during this period until a random bus ride near end of 7th grade where something literally just snapped inside me I had the mentality of a 7 year old and acted like one despite being 11 so anyway during that trip the showerhead in my cabin was aimed in a way so that we had to stand next to the toilet for the water to fall on us and my mind at that state said hell no and for the entire 5 days of that trip I did not have a bath I had a bath immidiately when I got home though but for some reason everyone ended up thinking that I had never had in my life and i ended up being treated like a disease and being avoided some people(mainly the girls) even went as far as to sanitize everything I touched. Having a 7 year old brain i became depressed(Wait for it) and then people said that my depression was just drama(and at that point it kind of was) but now I don't know if that entire incident is just drama like they said or my ptsd is valid

Some extra info: In my new school whenever people start hating me the memories come back and so do tears

1jfio6k,How do I stop being paranoid?,"This is one of my worst overthinking months of my whole life. It's to the point where I can't talk to people without being paranoid that I said something wrong. 

It started when my friends from my sports team sort of told me basically all the drama in the team, and I realised how much I need to control what I say if I don't want to be a target. That led to me just not talking, even outside of the team from paranoia and I think everyday whether I did something wrong or not.  

And in school a lot of my teachers really dislike me, or is annoyed with me. And I do believe that I'm a good student (last sem straight As), but I'm falling asleep a lot more in class and I'm having more trouble focusing. And also making connections and friendships with teachers like I did last semester.. I think I said something wrong or I did something that they disliked and it's really keeping me up at night.

1jfhv05,My cousin is a snake,"

To keep it short my cousin ghosted me for around a year, and now he wants to “fix things”

Well I don’t know if I want to. I mean how can you ghost your own cousin accidentally? You know, unless it’s on purpose, either way I wasn’t in his mind.

Now the problem is his family is forcing my family to make me fix things, and my family is heavily favouring him.
Now even though what he did was wrong (it made it worse that I had no friends I just had graduated during this time)
I’m seen as the bad guy now because I don’t want to fix things, so now if I forgive him I’m basically doing a disservice to myself because I don’t want that energy with me but I got no other choice, except one.

This stresses me often and I think I’m gonna do something stupid at first it’s I would just break his phone pretty things but this isolation period really messed my mind up.

1jfhqhu,Emotionaly wrecked but can't afford therapy,"I(18m) have porn,masturbation,and internet addiction.
I started consuming pornography from a very young age (7 or 8 years old). My dad left his phone open someday , and I , as a curious child, checked it and you know the rest of the story.

Reflecting back on my childhood, I think i might have been emotionally abused as a child.
First of all i have super narcissistic sisters who did emotionally, and sometimes physically, hurt me.
My did also did hit me every now and then when he was not in the mood.
I found that my mother was texting other guys other than my dad at a very young age( 8, or 9?).
Growing up, i didn't REALLY reflect upon these instances in my life.

Now I'm really desperate for any emotions. I even watch sad movies cause i don't know why but I feel SOMETHING when i cry while watching these movies.

Now reflecting upon my childhood, I think the cause of my addictions and being emotionally unstable is the hurt i have been exposed to growing up.

Now i can't afford therapy but iam working as a tutor and hopefully i will be able to afford it in a year or two.
I can't ask my parents to give me money.

1jfhiny,In an effort to be understood,"TLDR; in efforts to try and better my situation I've come to realize that I have no sense of identity or any motivation in life outside of basic survival. 



I used to want to die. Sometimes still do. And to be clear--if I absolutely wanted to die I have the means to do it easy and quick. All it would take is a simple trip down the stairs to grab any (of many) instruments of carnage at my disposal. And the best part is no one would see it coming. But I'm no spring chicken to thoughts of death and there's too many people that rely on me to embrace the freedom of ceasing to exist.



I just recently turned 33 as of March 10th. I'm a Pisces. If you don't believe in that sort of thing I get it. I hardly believe in anything anymore...or maybe I just no longer have the capacity to care. Very interesting sign, Pisces. Typically known as sensitive and prone to emotions. I was a very sensitive kid growing up. Quiet and nervous. And had a lot of very not great things happen to him. I do check my privilege because I've met plenty of people who have had it worse than me. All of us suffer together, we just suffer in silence.

  
Child me went through a lot. Molestation. Shame. Mental and verbal abuse. Thankfully never physical--though sometimes I wonder if I would have preferred that instead of what abuse I did receive. Maybe it would have made me tougher in some twisted way. What I do know is that I've been depressed for what feels like as long as I've been around. Despite that I still get through my days. Some are harder than others--right now is a little bit stressful. But I don't want to talk about those things.

  
I want to talk about the walls I'm meeting while trying to better myself. I've had a medical scare that has 'woken' me up in some ways. But even though that has transpired (and I've been trying to apply myself) I still feel trapped. To not draw this out more than I have already; I believe I've spent so long wanting to die while untreated that I'm permanently broken. I have no goals, no passions, no dreams. I wouldn't say I'm unmotivated. Financial fears and the fear of death are quite the motivation. But when I boil everything down I realize there is nothing that I want outside of just surviving. Metaphorically; I'm on a boat in rough water without a map, with no stars to track and utterly unprepared.



And thanks to a decade (and a half) of bad decision making/making no decisions at all, I lack the luxury of opting out on the grinder I'm in. To state a few of these mistakes: I only went to college so I wouldn't be homeless, than I dropped out. I've only ever worked shitty jobs and did only what was expected and never applied myself to become something more. I live with my parents (bio mom, step-dad), because I can't afford a car or to live alone. Yeah sure my mom is blind so our agreement is much more symbiotic than most in my situation. But man I feel trapped and  feel like I have no future. Most days I don't even feel like a real person. And I think the only reason I'm noticing all this right now is because now I care. But it all just feels like too little too late. Like I can't fix myself.

  
I know the argument will be that I'm 'only 33' but I just feel so fundamentally off. I've never even been in an adult relationship because I can't get close to people without being uncomfortable. I want to feel normal so bad it hurts. I missed out on so many things because...I don't know--life was just easier when I would isolate myself and play video games growing up. I put in effort and people-please just enough so that I'm left alone. And now I have nothing.

  
I don't even know if I'm making sense anymore. Or if there is a question I'm trying to get answered. I think I just wanted a void to unleash some feelings on so thank you for that. I think back on when I was 19 and wanted to join the military simply because I just wanted someone to tell me what to do with myself. I was too fat though at 218 after losing like 75 lbs to begin with. Now I'm 314 lbs with a BP of 190ish over 139ish.  Maybe I'm just afraid of actually living.

1jfhahu,How do you comfort/soothe yourself when you are upset?,"I have a very hard time not going straight to self harm or unaliving myself when I’m very sad. I am emotional and tend to cry a lot. I have always been like this. It has lessened as I’ve aged, but it has recently gotten worse. This is especially when my boyfriend falls asleep while I am crying and something is noticeably wrong with me. He does this any time we are in bed or the bedroom and I am sad. Every time it happens, I have to leave the room or I will explode into a sobbing fit/panic attack which leads to an argument because he’s tired and basically just wants me to shut the f up. This time, I left the room and went upstairs to the spare room. I punched the mattress a couple of times and loudly sobbed alone for about 30 minutes. 

Let me explain why him doing this feels so triggering to me:

When I was a child, I had an evil step mother. Let’s call her Morticia. She was awful in many ways, but I’ll just tell you the relevant portion. Any time I would cry as a child, she would scream at me. She would scream, “Stop fing crying”, “I’ll give you a reason to cry”, “If you’re going to fing cry, do it in your room”, etc. It didn’t matter if I was injured, being bullied, I missed my dad, nothing. She never even asked why I was crying. There was never any comfort or assistance in managing my emotions. She would simply scream at me and send me away. Because of this, I spent many nights alone sobbing and wishing I had someone there to help me. I was constantly in survival mode. 

This being said, now, every time he does this to me, I feel so alone, worthless and abandoned all over again. It’s truly one of worst feelings in the world for me. Last time it happened, I got into my car in the middle of a snow storm and just drove around with a loaded gun in my passenger seat looking for a good place to shoot myself. I found the place, put the gun to my head, and put my finger on the trigger. I didn’t pull it. The only thing that kept me from pulling it was telling myself that I was being too dramatic and I just wanted attention. 

This time, I thought about it again. When this stuff happens, it makes me feel like the most worthless lonely piece of shit on the planet. I need good coping and self soothing skills. I’m in therapy, and all anyone ever says is to find good coping strategies. I don’t even know what that means. I’ve tried deep breathing, journaling, video diaries, blah blah. None of it works. I just end up stewing on it and thinking about unaliving myself until I fall asleep. Any suggestions?",2025-03-20 04:53:41,therapy

For the first time in my life I wet the bed, and it was a lot… definitely more than just a minor accident. I didn’t even wake up during it, and when I finally realized what had happened, I was in complete shock and embarrassment. I had to wake up my husband in the middle of the night to tell him what happened which he was actually very sweet about it and helped me clean up.

I’ve been seeing my therapist once a week for two years now, and I’m very comfortable with her. I share literally everything with her, she knows so much stuff about me that no one else knows. I know she probably wouldn’t judge me or react negatively but I still am having a really hard time bringing this up because it’s causing me so much anxiety.

My biggest barrier is my OCD. (Luckily, I do NOT have contamination OCD) But the past few nights, I’ve been waking up every 15-30 minutes to check that I haven’t wet the bed, and this obsession is seriously affecting my sleep and my ability to function during the day. I obsess over it all day at home and at work and constantly google looking for answers on why this happened and if this is normal to happen to someone my age just out of the blue. I know I need help processing this and I probably need to do ERP (not even sure how I would do ERP for this though), but I’m struggling to find the courage to discuss it with her.

Hi all,

Relatively new to CPTSD. I’ve spent the last few months / year trying to befriend my inner child and be a good parent to them. I’ve worked to meet their basic needs, listen to them & get to know their unique personality (although it’s been difficult and hazy)

Anyway, lately (after a big-ish trigger) I just find the little one within is completely distraught and inconsolable. They feel so much yearning - specifically for maternal affection and care - that I am trying to hard but feel so incapable of giving. The feeling that they feel rejected be their own mother feels too much to bare. The yearning for a mother figure and the sinking feeling that it cannot happen crashes over them every day like a wave. I just try and sit with them. I know my internal love, care and affection will never be the same as if they got it from their own mom but I don’t know what else I can do. Sometimes I wonder if my comfort is inadvertently making it worse because it’s highlighting a lack or feels like taunting them for what they didn’t get in childhood. Am I just going to feel this pain, loneliness and emptiness forever? Is there anything I can do? How should I be dealing with this in therapy?",2025-03-19 22:37:34,therapy

 This still allowed him to diagnose me w anxiety temporarily and prescribed me to an antidepressant right away.

What im worried about is, I've been researching on BPD symptoms for years now and I'm showing obvious signs and if you know, bpd is complex in itself AND to each person.

So, my next session is in 2 weeks and im thinking of writing down my struggles but i will have to dive in to some trauma,
why i think that trauma affects this part and that part, how this event caused me to act a certain way, why do i do this why do i do that, how that and that made me feel, how i reacted to this and that and jazz like that, the note will take PAGES. 
How much is too much?
Or should i write even more?
Is it okay at all to tell all my problems through notes like this?
(i answer when he questions, dont worry)
Should i not write like this every time?(probably)
Will he be bothered that i as a patient don't seem to have critical thinking when talking about traumas and problems about myself to better myself and that im choosing the easy way?

I recently started the search for my birth family.  Unfortunately, my parents (adoptive) have little to no interest, and I don’t want to dump all of these feelings on my partner. So, I’m considering starting up therapy again for multiple reasons, specifically this one. 

Thanks for the advice! Would love to hear from others about their adoption stories domestically or international!

1jf6ka1,Keeping track of what I want to talk about,"I'm doing a brief stint with a counsellor while I'm on a waitlist to see a trauma informed therapist for emotional neglect & cptsd.

Uh, I kind of have a problem where my mind is really disorganised a lot of the time and it makes it really hard for me to feel like I'm in control of my effort to heal because I don't know how to present my thoughts and experiences to the therapist.

 It's just a jumbled mess, or I have insights or things I want to talk about but forget about them by the time of the session. Or I become kind of passive in-session and don't know how to frame the discussion in terms of what feels important to me.

That's ok I guess, it's still helpful to talk about 'whatever' sometimes, but it feeds an ongoing frustration with expressing myself and sometimes it feeds insecurities around thinking the therapist finds me too passive or insincere.

I try to write a bullet point list but I get lost in what I'm trying to say. Is there a better way I can approach this?",2025-03-19 20:13:38,therapy

1jf5e7m,Ruminating about an old girlfriend,"A few weeks ago I had a very intense moment of reflection/recollection about breaking up with a girlfriend from high school, about 40 years prior, Yeah, I'm old. It was totally out of the blue.  I've a few sleepless nights thinking about it, her and wondering about ""what if"". I hadn't spoken to her since we broke up. I thought about her from time to time like I have with many people from my past, but in no way more prominently or frequently than anyone else. The main feeling was of regret for the way I ended it. It was mean and stupid, for no good reason. She was having problems at home, and as a teen ager I didn't want to deal with it ended it abruptly. I think it was a panic response.  That was mixed in with some shame for leaving her to deal with her messy problems with her family.  I wonder if it's connected with something I need to deal with in present day, but I can' figure out what it is.

I felt like an apology was long over due, so I got on ""the"" Facebook and found her through a mutual friend a couple of weeks ago. I sent her an apology and friend request and after a few days she read it and accepted my friend request. I didn't do anything after that and felt like I got it out of my system for the most part. But i'm still trying to figure out why I had the ""epiphany"" in the first place and what if anything I'm supposed to know or learn from it presently.

Then a few days ago she chatted me up on FB and we got caught up. I was ecstatic to know her as an adult, married and doing well. I had her pictured in my mind as the girl I was a jerk to and left hanging. She even had a picture of us from Homecoming. (-: 

So now i'm at work, processing all of this. Completely distracted and useless. Why is this taking up so much of my emotional bandwidth? I don't have any lingering romantic feelings. I do feel cosmically stupid for breaking up with her. But I've broken up with other girls, they with me and I've never had this manifest with them.  I'm perplexed. 

Any ideas about what's going on?

1jf4zhr,"Well this is a new one, my therapist ghosted me","My twin brother is going through chemo and my mental health has been not great. Stress higher, a sense of panic setting in etc. and I’ve been wondering if I am working with the right person. 

My therapist doesn’t have after hours help which is fine but wouldn’t even provide me a summary of our last session.

Not to be callous but if I’m paying a grand a month in therapy bills, please help remind me what we talked about in session.

Because of the lack of outside hours support, which I apparently do need and unwillingness to help remind me what we talked about in session I suggested we stopped work. Her work practices just didn’t align with my needs.

She recommended one last session to close out which I agreed to. Session was today. Time comes and goes. I sent her a text confirming if we had an appointment, nothing. My last email wasn’t responded to and I sent that in Monday. 

Just crickets.

Now I know I’m not the ideal client for everyone and have had some really good therapists that helped save me from SI. And I’ve had some bad therapists as well.

1jf4im6,Conflicting advice from me and my girlfriend's individual therapists after cheating...,"Curious to hear advice on this. I'm not sure if this is normal, or if our therapists are simply telling us what we want to hear...

For background, my girlfriend and I have been together five years, and I recently discovered she was a serial cheater during the first 2-3 years of our relationship, sleeping or making out with 4 of our mutual friends. Throughout this my therapist has been somewhat appalled by my partner's behavior, saying that I've handled this situation ""with grace"". My girlfriend's therapist on the other hand has been understanding of what happened, almost excusing her actions. This part isn't surprising. 

What is surprising is our two therapists are completely at odds with how to handle reconciliation moving *forward*. For example my girlfriend talks to one of her affair partners on a video call every week, because his company hired her as a freelancer right before d-day. She even physically sees him sometimes. I've asked her to end this relationship and my therapist thinks that's appropriate, especially since she has many other clients. My girlfriend's therapist meanwhile says that's unreasonable, since she makes a lot of money from him. It would only make my girlfriend feel resentment towards me for negatively effecting her professional life, all for something that would ""fail to fix my grievances anyways"".

Ok, fine. Next issue - we go to a wedding together and she has a lot of male friends there. Everyone is partying hard. This is somewhat triggering for me, since drinking with male ""friends"" is what lead to most events of cheating. I feel she's vaguely flirty with some of them, and when I tell her I'm unwell (I had a stomach bug) she says I should go to bed early and that she will go to the after after party ""with the boys"" alone. I say ok. She comes back at 2am.

A few weeks later I have a conversation with her about this. She has told me in the past that she has poor impulse control with sex, especially while drinking, and that this may have attributed to cheating. With this in mind I say that maybe she shouldn't go to late night, boozy hangs with men when I'm not around, since that could put her in a compromised situation. She gets extremely upset and starts crying, saying she feels hurt by me punishing her for things she hasn't even done, ""assuming the worst"" and generally not trusting her. I disagree.

Once again my therapist says this is a reasonable new boundary while trust is being rebuilt, but my girlfriend comes back completely energized from her session, telling me that she feels vindicated by HER therapist's take on the situation. That I am unjustly labeling my girlfriend as a broken and untrustworthy person, when the reality is that all of her cheating can be attributed to her feelings during the first two years of our coupling. I should lay off and trust her, because the ""context"" of our relationship is different, and she obviously loves me and is in a different place now. So why am I having grief about the events of this wedding??

Nevermind that I spent our entire relationship assuming the best (I was VERY permissive) when my gut was warning me, and that burned me. Badly. 

Do you see where this is going? Maybe this is why you keep the contents of your individual sessions to yourselves. Now we have this weird game of telephone where our counselors are like two parents backing up their kid's shitty behavior. 

Is this normal? I understand that you are your therapist's ""client"" and that they will inevitably have some bias, but this seems extreme. How can two professionals have such wildly different takes on the same situation? How do we even move forward when one of them contradicts every piece of common advice here?",2025-03-19 18:50:45,therapy

1jey9vn,How to get my dad to see therapy,"This is half to seek out advices and half to vent. The thing is, I don’t like my dad at all. I sort of hate him to my core. Every time he calls I feel like dying. Even my friends tell me that it’s best to cut ties.

The worst thing about all of this is that I cannot pinpoint why I hate him so much. He doesn’t overtly abuse me. I only remember around two times or so that he beats me - all horribly, though - but I wonder if it is really that horrible. I mean, one time he beat me and forced me to tell him why I cried, and then I just said whatever so that he would stop beating me. And then he used what I said in desperation to make fun of me with his friends. Then there’s the other time when I didn’t come out when he picked me up from school, because I had to wait for the school to hand over the prize that I won for a competition. I forgot to call him, which made him worried. He assumed I only came out late because I was irresponsible and only wanting to hang out with my friends, and he slapped me for trying to explain myself.

Those events are the only times he used violence on me. Compared to other Asian kids and my siblings, the number of occurrences is very few, and he mellows down as he gets older, so am I petty for holding a grudge? He did use violence a few times on my mom, though. It freaks me out but my mom keeps telling me that he only treats her horribly and not me, so I shouldn’t hate him.

He doesn’t financially abuse me, either, and still tried his best to send me abroad. And the things he did that drives me insane was pretty subtle, so I cannot really tell if it was emotional abuse or I was overreacting. He weaponize guilt against me a lot, but I guess it’s not in his intention but more like an Asian parent thing. Still, a lot of the reason why I want to run away from him so much is because I cannot take the guilt associated with him. Every time I see, hear, or think about him I feel so guilty I want to die.

Another thing I really, really hate about him is that he always badmouth my mom, especially when we’re eating. It’s the only thing he ever talks about. He paints my mom as some sort of unrecognizable monster, and it feels shitty as hell because I’m really close to my mom. He tells me that I am older now, so I should be able to “share his burden”, and it makes me so angry as I’m writing this because is it really something you should do to your kid? I don’t even know if what he says is actually true. My parents say very different things, and I know he himself is capable of lying. He keeps saying that he didn’t cheat on my mom, but I literally heard him talking to his side chick. Sure, maybe I misheard, but why did he lied to me when I asked him who he called at that moment, telling it was my sister? I’m very sure it was anyone but my sister, because the way he addressed the person is in no shape or form that was his kid.

Oh, and I feel like he gaslight me a lot, too. All that talk about my mom, and then he had the audacity to tell me that “I never told you to hate on your mom.” Yeah sure, he never said explicitly that I should hate my mom, but in every waking moment he tries to slander her until I do.

Whatever topic I started with, hoping to have a tolerable meal, he would always go back to my mom. One time I had a fight with him (mostly one sided from him, though. I just kept listening as he droned on), and he yelled at me that “why don’t you ever talk to me?” In my head, I was like “are you serious?” Like I said, every time I try to talk to him, he always veer the topic back to badmouthing my mom. Also, he never listen to literally anything I say. It took me years to tell him that I didn’t want to eat dinner with my sister (aka my second abuser). He never listened because he has this illusion of a family in his head that I absolutely must follow. I honestly think he loves that illusion more than he loves me. I told him a hundred times that I like having dinner alone, and yet he kept pestering me with the same question. I got so fed up that I started lying to have an easier life.

That is not to mention that if I ever get too emotional and frustrated with him, he will get even more emotional and shut me down with his even bigger emotion. My dad has always been a weirdly emotional man. At first I thought it was because of generational gap, that his generation has always been acting like that, or that I was too emotionally constipated to understand him. But a lot of the things he does or says unsettles me. He always expresses his emotions in such an overt way that it freaks the hell out of me. He is also quick to temper. Is it some sort of disorder?

Anyhow, my dad has driven a lot of people out of his life. He and my mom are divorced. My sister has cut ties with him, I begin avoiding him like plague (best decision ever), and my brother is abroad so he barely keeps in touch (he also has a tendency to avoid our parents, too). Furthermore, he is the only son in his family and also the only person who has made it to higher education, so it’s hard for his siblings to relate to him and he can’t exactly talk to them about anything. His nieces and nephews (and possibly his own siblings) are more interested in his money than anything. He always acts like he has a lot of friends and pushes me to go outside and make many friends like him (he gets sulky the moment I actually hang out with my friend, though 🙃). Yet with how much he forces his trauma onto me (while simultaneously telling that I’m too weak and that I need to be stronger to “share his burden”), I don’t think he actually has any real close friends. 

That is not to mention that his generation has a really distorted view of family and friendship. They think family is the absolute number one and friendship is just some temporary, disposable thing. I see this in many elders in my country, not just him. Despite our completely incompatible personality, despite the fact that every conversation between us can never last longer than 3 minutes, or 5 minutes max, he is still heavily dependent on me to relieve his loneliness. I looked up the term covert incest, and it accurately describes the relationship between me and my dad.

Today when he called me, he sounded really miserable. He told me he didn’t even do his routine cycling, which is really concerning. I feel like he’s fallen into depression but I don’t know what to do. My mental health is getting a little bit better now that he is out of my life, and I’d rather shoot myself than to call him frequently. I feel like the best course of action for him right now is to go to therapy, but he belongs to a generation where going to therapy is heavily stigmatized. Also he never listens to me anyway, I don’t even know why I bother to try, but is there a way to get him to see a therapist? Can I ask a therapist to go to my dad’s house?",2025-03-19 14:28:24,therapy

I have been dismissed as we all have been in some way. I was lucky to experience it very soon in relationships that should have been safe, when I still couldn't really grasp what it meant. It certainly prepared me better for what I was going to go through. But that doesn't make any of it OK, not with anyone.


Reaching out for professional help is brave, it is often what seems like a last resort. But those places are not always safe. I personally experienced only one matching safe place in therapy out of 5. This translates into a 20% chance to find a therapist that would actually be helpful. 
This is ridiculously low. A therapist being unhelpful, if not straight up bad is *not* a neutral situation. From a place of despair, any interaction has deep impacts. And professionals come with an authority that is hard to fight, especially when our state is fragile, when trying feels hopeless, when our thoughts already need energy to be fought.


I want to believe that I've been unlucky, it would mean that things are better for others, but it seems all too common a tendency for me to truly believe that. 


Mental health issues are on the rise. Maybe you've been lucky, maybe you've looked down on those with such issues, but statistically, your kids, your nephews, are next. It is alarming. 

I am sharing those snippets of my history because while I was dismissed, you are not. You are not dismissed from playing your part in our collective responsibility to create a caring society. 


It starts at our level. 


It starts with how we interpret what we see. How do we label people who don't fit our expectations? How do we react when someone's acting differently than they used to? How do we act towards someone struggling? Do we ever push people to get a sense of satisfaction?


It starts in the space between each other.
Whether with colleagues, relatives, friends, strangers, lovers.
What do we bring to that space? How do we nurture it? Is it shared equally? What can enter it, what can't, and why?


It starts with ourselves. 
Are we accepting ourselves and our flaws? Are we putting our comfort first? Are we allowing connection? Vulnerability? What and who feels safe? What and who doesn't? Why? When are we defensive? When are we betraying ourselves? How is fear guiding us? What are we blocking? What are we fleeing? Are we observing our behaviours and others'? Are we aware of our impact on others and are we taking accountability and responsibility for it? Are we truly listening? Are we acting or hoping? Are we trying, are we questioning, are we learning, are we improving? Or are we dismissing, resigning, avoiding?


Helping and receiving help are equally hard. Our efforts may not always matter, they may go unnoticed, get deflected and dismissed. But I think our collective power lies in trying, in refusing to give up, in keeping our light going and making it grow. With every smile, every eye contact, every small act of care, through every way we can show that we remember something about someone because we listened, that we recognise what someone did and contributed to, that we understand a situation someone is going through and how it does feel. It lies in every question that replaces judgment, it lies in acceptance replacing criticism. We're all flawed and we're never going to love everyone. But we don't have to make ourselves feel better at the expense of anyone, we don't have to bond through judgment, through the cultivation of feeling superior to anyone.
We can instead start to bond because we make space for each other, because we make each other feel seen, appreciated and accepted. 


I am not trying to advocate for a naive and impossible vision of interpersonal relationships. But it doesn't take that much to change a dynamic. It's inviting someone to join a group, it's calling out a bully, it's sitting with someone isolated, it's backing the voice of those who speak up, it's showing understanding for those who struggle. It's a thank you, a compliment, a 'are you okay?'.


What if we started to truly care for each other and show up? 


As James Baldwin said: everyone you're looking at is also you. But maybe you first need to see yourself fully.


A ridiculous amount my 34 years, I have dealt with mental health issues. I have gone in and out of darkness more than once and reached depths many will luckily never know. Sometimes, life hangs on not much more than a feeling of guilt, a memory of kindness or new music to discover.
We are fragile and our battles are unseen a lot of the time. 
The system is failing us and we are failing each other.
It is not to say professional help is not needed and helpful, it absolutely is. If my story is common though, it is easy to not feel that way and to give up. That's why we need to step up for each other.

1jex5y2,AI-Assisted Therapy? I Used ChatGPT for Real-Time Trauma Integration—And It Worked.,"**I know this sounds wild, but hear me out.**

I’ve been using ChatGPT in a way that I don’t think many people are yet—**as a real-time therapeutic tool for deep trauma integration.** Specifically, I’ve developed something I call **Transpersonal Integrative Therapy (TIT),** which combines concepts from **Internal Family Systems (IFS), Polyvagal Theory, Compassionate Inquiry, and Transpersonal Psychology.**

💡 **What’s different about my approach?**

• I’m not just using AI to “journal” or reflect. I’m **actively engaging in deep parts work, grief processing, and real-time integration.**

• I achieved **full Exile integration and Self-leadership at a speed rarely seen in traditional therapy.**

• I use AI **as an immersive therapeutic space** rather than just a passive tool.

**This is new territory. This isn’t just “self-help with AI”—this is structured psychological transformation happening through AI-assisted engagement.**

I submitted feedback to u/OpenAI requesting **expanded memory capabilities**, because right now, the biggest limitation is that AI doesn’t remember enough long-term context for serious therapeutic work.

**What I’m Curious About:**

**Has anyone else experimented with AI for deep therapeutic processing?**

I’m not saying AI should replace therapists. But **I AM saying it’s already helping people in ways we aren’t fully talking about yet.** And I think this conversation needs to happen.

Also at 11 I'd touch myself and look at my body in the mirror and i kinda had issues and would harm myself too. I also most cut myself down there with saftey scissors but the cold shook me out of it and remembered it'd hurt and i don't know how to care for it and I'm never telling my parents so it was clearly a stupid stunt and stopped but i still had the impulse to hurt myself especially sexually.

Can normal physical abuse lead to these behaviors? My parents were mild with it and were authoriatiarian corporal parents, i wouldn't expect that to affect my desires to be like that or have issues with harm and my body like that. 

Maybe it's cuz growing up religous i was taught to abstain from sexual things and masturbation but when stressed since i was 11 i would look up aggressive porn and touch myself till it burned and i think it was more for the dopamine feeling but not sure what the rougher part was about. For years I'd try and abstain then relapse and hate myself for it and falling for the devil's temptation but would frequently end up touching myself multiple times a day mostly via humping my blanket or a toy. I'm not sure how normal it is for kids to act like this or if these behaviors are signs of addiction.

Nowadays i have a healthier relationship to it but it's not perfect and i still find myself touching multiple times a day and feeling gross for it. Sometimes tho randomly i can go a week or two without anything but it seems when my hormones fluctuate during my cycle or something it's taking over my alone time

I'm just really worried cuz i look at my behaviors now and try and look back as to why I'm like this ya know",2025-03-19 11:45:24,therapy

1jetv4s,We think my girlfriend is going to die,"My girlfriend found out 5-6 months ago that she has 3 tumors in her head. 2 on the sides and 1 on the brainstem/spinal cord. She has been doing a lot of medication to try and reduce them so that they can be small enough to operate on. So far the 2 on the sides have gone down but the other one hasn't at all. The doctor said that they might try radiation as they are running out of treatments/medication. Something to note is that when they found the tumors, they said if they couldn't remove them that she would have 2 years left. I'm not sure what it is exactly that is going to do it but I'm guessing it's something to do with the main tumor getting too big and cutting off blood flow/oxygen to her brain. She has seizures almost daily because of this. We try not to think about this happening but lately she has been getting more depressed. We talked about it a bit tonight and she confirmed my suspicions of her feeling helpless and wanting to give up trying.

We have been together for just over 4 years and I have been thinking about asking her to marry me a little before all this happened but it has put a hold on that. I feel like it is a bigger issue to deal with than trying to plan a wedding. If all else fails and they can't remove it, I am going to ask her and say we should do a small quick wedding at a courthouse or something like that. I know she has always wanted to get married, have a family, etc. but if it's not in the cards, I want to do whatever I can, while I can to make her dreams come true.

I have been trying to mentally deal with all this. Sure I've talked to friends about it but it's not getting all the results I am looking for. There is still some things that talking to them isn't solving.",2025-03-19 10:28:42,therapy
1jetenv,"My therapist is trying to be helpful, but I just want a space where I can be completely vulnerable.","I am in an intensive outpatient program for an eating disorder. Therefore, I had to stop seeing my outpatient therapist due to insurance reasons. After therapy with my assigned therapist, I usually always feel worse about myself. 

For context, I was talking about my body image issues in a previous session and they went around and around with me about medications (which ones Im taking and why) and how I was being “all or nothing” in my reasoning. I wish I could just speak my most vulnerable feelings into existence without being met with judgement or constant unhelpful suggestions.  
 
I haven’t been able to fall asleep, because Im ruminating about our session today and I already struggle with insomnia. Today’s session I talked about my discussion with my long distance partner about my needs for connection. I told my therapist that I would like my partner to call me ideally once a day for ~5ish minutes and when I do see them (since it’s only once a month for 1-2 days max) I want them to prioritize being present with me. We are both in college, but we both have cars and only live about an hour and a half apart. We have also been together for four years.  Anyways, I gave my therapist more details regarding why I feel so hurt about this and they ended up coming up the conclusion that Im placing too much pressure on my partner and that Im trying to control what they do in their free time. I’m assuming it’s because I said it bothers me when I text my partner and they say they’re “chilling”… yet they don’t make time to call me despite me voicing that it is important to me.  I also periodically ask what they are up to during the day, but I just want to feel connected to them. 

I need therapy to process intense emotions without laying it all on my partner or friends. I don’t know how to get the most out of these sessions and Im getting to the point where I don’t want to share anything out of fear of being judged or ridiculed.

1jermcz,Mixed feelings about favorite basketball player,"I know this is a weird question to ask, but wasn't sure where else to ask. I apologize if it's not appropriate for this sub.


I grew up in SoCal, a big Lakers fan, a big Kobe Bryant fan. I witnessed Kobe's entire career, and he was absolutely my favorite player. I had his jerseys, had his stats memorized, watched every Laker game, etc.


As many people know, in 2003, he was accused of sexual assault. When this happened, I was a teenager and I was shocked. Eventually, the charges were dropped, a settlement was reached, and he didn't go to jail.  After that, I assumed he was innocent, and I continued being a Kobe/Lakers/NBA fan.


After he retired in 2016, the MeToo movement began around that time.  Some of the discussions around that time brought up Kobe's past.  This caused me to read up on his case again.  Now that I was older, I had a different perspective on the case and everything that happened involving that case, and basically..... I just could never look at Kobe the same again. (I don't know if he's guilty or not, but the details of the case don't make him look great....)


After that, I kind of toned down my Kobe fandom. I felt kind of guilty. Like, ""Was I supporting a rapist all these years?""


Then he shockingly passed away in 2020, and I was devastated when that happened.  My favorite player, and his daughter and many others, died in a helicopter accident.  After his death, the whole world paid tribute to him. While I was sad, I also felt uncomfortable at the amount of tributes and praise he was getting.


Anyways, I just don't know how to feel about Kobe these days. I am still a Lakers fan and basketball fan, so I can't avoid Kobe.  His jerseys are hanging up in the Lakers' arena.  He is a Laker legend, a basketball legend, and his name comes up in basketball discussions all the time. I still watch his highlights on youtube every now and then to reminisce. Then I say to myself, ""Man should I be watching his highlights?""


I just have these mixed feelings about him. Can anyone here relate? Have you felt weird about famous person you looked up to, that may have done bad things? Are people that continue to praise and celebrate his career, doing a disservice to sexual assault survivors/victims? 


Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks.",2025-03-19 07:35:19,therapy
1jerci9,I cant tell if my suffering is self inflicted or not. PLEASE HELP!!,"Hey I just want to preface this by saying, yes I know that I am a bad person but Im sorry I dont know why I act like this.

To get the point, I am a person who wants to be mentally ill so that people will take pity on me. I purposfully hurt myself just for the sake of being able to say that I've hurt myself. Ever since I was a kid I fantisied about having niche mental illnesses that people would be shocked by. As an 8yr old I was obsessed with diagnosing myself as a psychopath becuase I had very low empathy. Ever since I was young I was obsessed with the idea of having complex mental disorders, usuallly these mental disorders were ones that youtubers who I looked up to struggled with. I've always been like this even with other things like gender, when I was a young teen I identified myself as a transman, genderfluid person, all kinds of identities that I didnt actually feel, I have always been comfortible being a girl but the idea of having some cool gender identity always got me. I fantisied about having this traumatic life story that I could tell to others and make them feel so shocked and sad for me. 

I fantisied about being ruthlessly bullied in school and fantisied about my friends (who were good people who I got along with) were horrible and toxic to me. This was because whenever I heard about someone having a bad experience, I have a urge to make my experience way worse for some reason. Yes I was that kid who wished she had tourettes and got all my diagnosis from the internet. 2 years ago I was in a confusing place in my life and I ended up convincing myself that I had psychosis/schizophrenic visions that god was convincing me to kill my best friend, I was not having any visions at all but I wanted to so I could convince my therapist to send me to the psych ward.

I dont know why I did these things as I was never searching from direct attention from other people as I was terrified of being caught lying and I had severe social anxiety, but instead I guess I was just searching for self validation. I used to embellish stories at my therapy sessions, I never directly lied as usually my mum was in the room with me but Im pretty sure that my Autism diagnosis was from me overdramitsing my symptoms. I dont know what to do, I am completely self aware of how bad these things are but I just can stop wishing that my life was horrible. 

Ive suffered a lot of imposter syndrome and I guess this just fuels me to embellsh my symptoms even more because I want to feel justified in being sad. Its gotten to the point where I cant consume any media where people are suffering from health issues or mental illness as it makes me fantisise about being like that and wanting to purposefully hurt myself so I can be like that. I dont think it was ever for attention just more self validation in knowing that there is something wrong with me. I dont know what to do anymore its getting out of hand. I recently purposfully overdosed on pills, I didnt want to end my life or anything I just wanted to say I did so my psychologist would be concerned about me. This has made me so parinoid i dont even know if my own emotions are just products of me forcing myself to feel that way. What should I do???!!! Should I tell a professional?? I dont know if anything i am thinking or feeling is real anymore.",2025-03-19 07:14:05,therapy

1jepix2,I can't handle other people's feelings.,"I miss when I used to feel very strong emotions like crying, panic attacks, all of those things that made me feel alive.

Now I don't feel them anymore, or they've lessened. I don't really know if that's a good thing. I'm not saying I don't cry. I can cry, but not with the same intensity or always. I usually do it when I've reached my limit, and that's when I feel abnormal.

Since I was very young, I don't think I was ever able to feel emotions in the moment; I would bottle them up and then let them go. I had a period in high school where I was almost always feeling something or crying. Now, in college, I don't feel it at the same level or as often. I no longer feel a great affection for new people who become my friends (I don't care if they stop talking to me, if we're no longer friends someday, or if they understand me). I also don't believe romantic connections are genuine. Any move someone makes to show interest in me, I simply notice and push away; some even annoy me.

My sister is the complete opposite: very sensitive and shows how she feels. Then she asks me for advice, and when she starts crying, I can't handle those emotions. I don't like seeing others feel that way, and not because I hate it or think it's wrong. It affects me to a point where it makes me uncomfortable, and I wish she'd stop, so I just giving her ""logical and obvious"" answers.

They often tell me I don't have feelings, that I only cry out of frustration, but nothing ""genuine."" I don't know if it's normal to feel and be that way; sometimes it seems so abnormal, and as if I'm faking it.

I only have a strong emotional connection with my family and my pets. I'm starting to see that I've distanced myself from anything other than that.

1jeo6hb,How do I address intimacy problems?,"I have been seeing a therapist for two years to talk about trauma. I have told her a lot about past experiences with men when I was a minor, so she knows about all of that.

What she doesn't know is that I'm unhappy/dissatisfied in my relationship of six years. My partner never initiates or thinks about, or even wants, to be intimate with me. He has never been interested in it. My therapist doesn't know about that. She has met my partner, and he has come into her office with me once to talk about something else. She offers couple counseling but he has never wanted to do that (or individual). But she has met him and thinks highly of him.

The trouble is, three years ago I was sexually assaulted by a man and my therapist has been helping me with that. I already blame myself immensely for it. If I tell her now about my failed sex life, then that makes everything I've said about the SA less credible. It would seem like I let a man have sex with me because my boyfriend doesn't touch me... and maybe there is truth to that, but I didn't want to be assaulted. I didn't want any of that.

The cards all have personal questions on them and she’s given them to me to answer before in practice. Today however she allowed me to ask her a question back in return. She told me about her childhood, her parents, her sex life, and even about work place relations.

Welp.. there was ""other stuff"" I occasionally wanted to mention but it sounded so out there that I decided not to talk to a therapist or anyone as a matter of fact. It all would occasionally stop for a little bit before building back up.

I've been overhauling my lifestyle and making some really good and beneficial changes in my life. Over these two and a half years, I've managed to face some fears, insecureties and repressed trauma I've been holding on to. I've gotten new experiences, tried out new things, gotten back to my old hobbies, and learned to appreciate myself more. Even found my first-ever relationship a year ago. All this has also included stuff like bettering my diet, losing weight and working on my physical health. It's going so well, and I'm honestly pretty proud of myself.

But I seem to have kind of an odd problem. Excersice-induced depression. Whenever I try out any form of excersice, and attempt to make it a sustainable routine, I get super depressed. I've made all changes very slowly and not forcing myself to it. At first I just started walking my commute, it was horrible for a couple of months, but I managed to get over it. Then I added a dance class, because it sounded fun. It was, but afterward I've found myself crying in the shower more than once. It has gotten better, but I still get occational bouts of deep sadness after. Recently I've taken up the gym. It too makes me uncontrollably sad. I feel like I could just collapse into a puddle of tears when I get home. At the same time I'm very irritated and unnecessarily aggressive. Short tempered. Sensitive. I get upset easily. It's like being a teenager again, with all the hormone highs and lows.

All this is so exhausting and I'm so tired of constantly fighting against myself. It's like something in me WANTS to go back to my old life, resisting every good thing I try with everything it has.

1jehuq2,I want to go back to therapy. Looking for advice on what type of therapy I need.,"So I saw a councilor at my university a few years ago. I've since graduated and want to go back to therapy. Of course this time it won't be as easy as going to my school's counseling center.

My health insurance is pretty good so cost won't be a factor so long as they're in network.

Unfortunately, my experience with the counselor was not great... but also not bad. She was very kind but clearly didn't understand me. She also just let me talk ad nauseam during sessions, which I didn't like.

The issues I'm having include the fact I'm not assertive enough, I want more direction in life, and I want to increase my emotional intelligence. So, learn some skills whilst solving an existential crisis.

Given these variables, what should I look for in a counselor/what type of therapy should I seek? I've heard of DBT, CBT, etc. but my knowledge of them doesn't exceed a google search.

tldr: I want to be lead during sessions, learn skills, and solve an existential crises. What type of therapy should I seek? Any other considerations?

Thanks in advance.",2025-03-18 22:27:59,therapy
1jegry2,My life,"No one wants to read such a long life story. So I’ll try to make it as short as possible. 

From birth to 8 years old

* Dad gambled and borrowed money from dangerous people and went on the run. Loan sharks would come over to our home and demand money while my mom was pregnant with my brother. 

* We moved to the US from Vietnam. Which means new victims for my dad to con. My dad conned women by telling them he would elope with them and had taken maybe 100k+ from 10+ women which in 2005 was a lot more than now. 

* Mom was also having affairs because dad wasn’t good to her. They taught me how to lie. How to lie to them and how to lie to those that knock on our door. I became really good at lying but it was to the point where I lied when I didn’t have to. If I had one egg for breakfast, I don’t know why I would say I had two.

* Mom was always crying about dad, dad was always drunk and gambling. Many domestic abuse and many threats of burning the house down. 

8 - 18 years old

* I was a happy kid. I now laugh at my elementary school journal about my childhood because someone should’ve called CPS. 

* Broke family, couldn’t hang out with friends because everyone had allowance when I had nothing. But they were kind. Some friends I paid back 10x now that I have a job (24yrs old)

* Sister was always depressed but kept up a happy front because depression doesn’t exist in Asian culture. She was 5 years older and went towards a path she didn’t want in college so she could support our family.

* I felt guilty. So much guilt that I got a job the moment I turned 16, $9/hour with about 30 hours a week so they wouldn’t break any child labor laws. Saved up about $2,000 back in 2017. Dad borrowed that money then died in 2017. Was very sad because I was the only one that loved him in the family despite everything. I wanted to see the good in people.

* Started writing my own absent notes for high school and just slept all day. No one noticed. 

College and beyond

* College was great. I made so many new friends. Got male attention. As much as I hate to admit it, male attention was what reassured me that I was attractive and wanted. Had that phase with partying and messing around. Missed classes and just drank a lot. 

* Got my life together because I got a caring boyfriend. Caring boyfriend acted like my cheating dad and I became insecure. So I tried to talk it out and break up but he cried every time I tried. So I stuck with it. For 3 years I was in a relationship I didnt want to be in and I felt so trapped, depressed, and with someone who threatened his life if I broke up with him. Then drinking became a weekly thing. Eventually, I cheated. I wasn’t a good person. I’ve always hated cheaters and I still don’t think what I did was right. 

* Eventually, we broke up and all my friends found out that I cheated so they stopped being my friend. Lost my boyfriend who even though trapped me was still my best friend and I lost all my friends along with that. 

* 2023, lost everyone. Started drinking every day. Maybe 8-10 shots a day. Tried to commit suicide once and confronted my mom who said it was just stress and I was overreacting. 

* Stopped drinking for my own sake and started taking edibles. Edibles in the morning, afternoon, and evening. I was okay again. Time passed like I was waiting for my body to deteriorate. 

Now (2024-2025) 

* I found a boyfriend who tries to make me stop my alcoholic ways and to stop taking edibles. It worked for a few months.

* Sober for many months. Then my whole family died. Snuck in alcohol and edibles throughout the day without my boyfriend knowing. Flaking on friends, ignoring messages, and really all the self-sabotage.

* Looking for a therapist that can deal with me or at least talk to me in an unbiased sense because my friends from college are starting to become therapists now and they’re amazing people but I don’t think they’re qualified to be therapists with their own mental health problems like me.   

In conclusion, I’m not okay but I keep faking that I am. I believe I’m a good person by donating to charity or using all my money to start a homeless shelter in Asia BUT it’s really just to make myself feel better about all the bad I’ve done. So in reality, I’m not a good person. I’m someone trying to convince myself that I am. 

Someone from my previous post said I could vent here and it would be okay. I’m sorry for writing such a long post.

1jegqp5,Is it possible to “not be ready for therapy”?,"My sister and bf have both suggested therapy for me. My sister especially. And I won’t deny that I probably need it. I have experienced trauma when I was younger. 

But I’ve only had bad experiences with mental health support like this and I really don’t want to bother with this. Plus, I feel like I’m functioning fine without it. I’m not doing harmful and reckless behavior like in the past. 

Maybe I’d go through with it if it just wasn’t such a hassle. I heard therapy is a lot of trial and error and while I know the importance of mental health, I feel like getting a therapist isn’t worth the time and effort. ",2025-03-18 21:39:57,therapy

1jeeqn8,Ran into a problem with seeking remote out-of-state therapy (Michigan),"Maybe a tiny bit vent-y of a post but genuine advice would be appreciated.

I just finished my first session of therapy in probably a decade and my first virtual therapy session ever. I feel very emotionally spent but I feel like the therapist that I scheduled with is super knowledgable, did a fantastic job of helping me talk about the issues that had brought me in, and I would feel very good about working with in the future. 

The only problem (and a pretty big one) is the requirement with Michigan licensed therapists to do sessions with clientele while they're in state, and only being able to provide services to clients located within state, or however it works, I'm not 100% certain but that more or less was my understanding of what she said. 

See, I'm planning on moving out of the country in September for work. This is part of why I wanted to explore virtual as an option; I want to start therapy and strike up a long-term relationship with a therapist that I could work with and maintain while I'm abroad via the Zoom sessions. But, if I'm living outside the country, then it doesn't sound like I'll be able to continue with this person bc of how insurance works in Michigan or something, and I don't know how exactly I would find any other therapist right now that could continue to work with me if this is something that remains true for all licensed Michigan therapists. 

And it just plain sucks. I really liked this therapist. She was a great listener and came up with a sort of therapy roadmap for dealing with the things I unloaded in the first session that I really liked the sound of. Plus, and maybe this sounds silly, but it took monumental effort and bravery to finally open up to and talk about anyone about the shit I've been dealing with alone until now; starting over and doing this all again with someone else sounds both daunting and exhausting. 

What do I do? How can I find a great therapist that I can work with both over the next six months here in Michigan and while I'm abroad in a non-English speaking country that I probably won't be in forever and, even if I was, finding a good English speaking therapist could be a needle-in-a-haystack situation?

1jeeo25,What should i do? I don’t like my therapist,"so i’ve been seeing this lady for the past couple of months and from the very first session, something just felt off. I’ve been seeing her for 2 months and I still feel like she hasn’t got a clue who I am. I’m currently struggling with GAD and an eating disorder (in recovery for over a year) and have been for about 5 years, she just seems to link everything to experiences I don’t remember when I was a toddler such as my Dad being an alcoholic and then quitting alcohol when I was two years old. 

It’s always focused on the past and i don’t feel like i get any closure or comfort for the present moment. 

I’ve also missed a couple of appointments because i’ve been so caught up in everyday life and i understand that she has clients and she’s on a schedule but she’s evidently pissed off when i forget and asks me to pay for the missed appointment

. I get that it’s bad to miss an appointment but i figured a therapist would show a bit more compassion and understanding based on what i’ve been dealing with. She’s quite cold and often critical of my actions whenever i do attend, If i bring up my eating disorder, she will dismiss it based on the fact that i’m in recovery and have gotten help with it before( I haven’t)  Is this normal? I feel like I need to go and try to see somebody else because it’s actually causing me more stress rather than helping me",2025-03-18 20:14:10,therapy

Today, this anxiety fog put me in a “dumb” position in front of my colleagues, some emergency happened at work.

I felt really embarrassed and upset when I could witness my self being blank of whatever they said.

As a kid, I use to be called out for being stupid. I remember my dad saying, “you can’t even do this simple problem” while he was teaching math division problems.

I am in my early 20s now. Last week I was taunted again for being very restless when something unusual happens suddenly. I feel really helpless in these situations.

1jecmyk,How journaling helped me open up emotionally. Anyone tried it as a complement to therapy?,"I’ve always struggled with putting my emotions into words. I know therapy is a safe space, but sometimes I catch myself holding back, not cuz I don’t trust my therapist, but cuz some things feel too hard to say out loud.

A while ago, I started journaling as a way to untangle my thoughts. At first, it felt kinda awkward, like I was just narrating my day. But over time, I noticed something interesting: writing gave me permission to be completely honest with myself in a way that talking didn’t.

I’d write about stuff I hadn’t fully processed, fears I wasn’t ready to admit, and even things I had no intention of telling my therapist (at least not yet). But the more I wrote, the more I started connecting the dots, why I react a certain way, what triggers certain feelings, and what I actually need to feel better.

Eventually, I started bringing some of these insights into therapy. It helped a ton. Instead of feeling stuck or overwhelmed, I actually had a clearer idea of what I wanted to talk about.

Lately, I started messing around with an AI journaling tool just to see if it could help me spot patterns in my emotions. Wasn’t expecting much tbh, but sometimes just seeing a summary of my own thoughts helped me process things differently.

Idk, has anyone else used journaling to help with therapy? Do you ever struggle to bring certain thoughts into sessions? Would love to hear how others approach this.",2025-03-18 18:53:06,therapy

1jec4wr,I shared my story about abuse with my friend and now I regret it,"I’ve been carrying something really heavy for a long time, and recently I decided to share it with someone I trust. I told her about the sexual abuse I went through when I was younger, how it’s something I’ve tried to cope with on my own for years. I thought telling her might help me feel better, and for a short while, it did. But now, I feel confused. I can see the shift in the way she looks at me, like she’s seeing me differently, and I don’t want that.
I don’t want to be seen as just someone who’s been through something painful. I’m not just my past, but now it feels like every time we have a good moment, she’s thinking about what I went through instead of just enjoying our time together.

I also told her that I talked to my mom about what happened, and even though I still love her, it’s hard to explain. My mom stayed with him for months after the abuse happened, and that really hurts. But I can’t just stop loving her. I don’t know how to make sense of that. When my friend asked how I could still love my mom, I just said that it’s something that’s there, even though it doesn’t make sense sometimes.

Now, I’m starting to question if sharing all of this was a mistake. I didn’t want to lose her as a friend, but I don’t know if things will ever feel the same again. I just wanted someone to know and to understand me, but now I’m not sure if it’s changed everything between us.

1jebim7,My therapist told me to find someone else,"After an unfortunate experience that led me to the psychiatric unit in Late August/ Early September (and a diagnosis with Borderline Personality Disorder), I have been seeing an individual therapist twice a week specializing in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). After about half a year of seeing her, she finally told me that I need to find someone else. She said she wasn't able to help me and that I needed to try someone else who might be able to suit me better.

After looking for a while, I found a new individual provider and a DBT skills group. But its hard. I feel abandoned. In my head I just feel like I'm being told ""Your head is so messed up that I can't fix you"". 

This is the second time that a therapist has done this. If I had a nickel for each time I had a therapist tell me I needed someone else because they felt as if they didn't know how to help me, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot but its exhausting that it happened twice.

Seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow. Hoping to find some sort of solution like stronger meds but I dunno. I feel like I hit a brick wall.

1je8yr9,"I had children with my groomer, finding it hard to cope.","I was just 15 when I met him; he was 28. A friend of my mom's from work, he'd come to our house, hang out, do drugs with my parents. It wasn't long before he offered them to me. At fifteen, I was using methamphetamine. Our relationship escalated quickly; I ran away with him. He was arrested for interfering with custody, and I spent the next couple of years in foster care.

At seventeen, I was pregnant with our first son, and I had him at eighteen. Over the years, we had two more children and even bought a house together. At the time, it felt like a normal relationship. It wasn't until much later that I understood the true nature of what he was.

We separated nine years ago, wanting different things, and just generally being incompatible (no shit, huh). We've maintained split custody, alternating weeks, without child support. Now, with our children getting older – 15M, 13M, 11M – I find myself reflecting on our past. I struggle with the anger and resentment, the feeling that he stole my youth. Part of me wonders if my children should know the truth about him, but another part questions the purpose. Is it for them, or is it for my own selfishness?

I just don’t feel like the person they believe me to be and so I fake being someone who I really don’t care about and it drives me up the wall, I get angry, I get upset, and occasionally depressive with the thought of dying and never having been honest about myself, especially if I don’t get received in an afterlife or reincarnated.

My parents are two different levels of people,
Mom is stoic and believes that if I want to change my gender then I should accept the disappointment from my family and live my own life, but I simply cannot take family disappointment, I’v never had anything other in my life than their constant love as a son and if it went away, I would just be thrusted into this world alone.

My dad is just sensitive and cares a lot, him being so upset would devastate me (when he gets really angry he says things he doesn’t really mean but just feels In the moment with other things to say that would attack my character)

It’s a daily struggle of feeling that I could be someone, but I’m not, I don’t know how to be a man I like or feel like a man I approve of. I don’t like to over react but I think sometimes there’s just something wrong with me and that I just need to see a professional about it, having felt a greater connection with a female concept of myself than a male concept of myself (I draw pictures of the person I think I’d be and she is always happy with her life)
